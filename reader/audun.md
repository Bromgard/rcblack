# AUÐUNAR ÞÁTTR
## Frá Því er Auðunn enn vestfirzki fœrði Sveini konungi bjarndýri
## Part 1

>1\. Maðr hét Auðunn, vestfirzkr at kyni ok félítill.

* Let's begin by looking at the first three words. Old Icelandic is a SVO language, which means that word order is generally governed by this order: __subject, verb, object__. Icelandic is often further categorized as a V2 language, which means that the expectation that the verb lies in __second position__ is a reliable pattern. From this rule we can guess that _Maðr_ is the subject, _hét_ is the verb. 
* [Maðr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/maðr) is a masculine noun that is in the nominative case. It is cognate with English _man_ and shares the same meaning here, but sometimes means "person." Take a look at the suffixed "r" at the end. The "r" is a nominal declension ending that tells us that it is masculine and that it occurs here in the nominative case. Click on the link and take a look at the declension chart. So, we know that this is the subject of the sentence. For basic usages Wiktionary is a great resource but keep in mind that it is not comprehensive and the definitions are very simplified. Make sure you keep Zoëga or Cleasby/Vigfusson on hand.
* As you go, slow down, and take your time getting used to the dictionary resources. Explore the definitions and acquaint yourself with the declension and conjugation charts. Remember, this is a reading class first. You don't need instant recall right away.
* Our verb is _hét_ and we know this because it is in second position. The lexical form, the form as it is listed in the dictionaries, is [heita](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/heita#Old_Norse). This entry tells us that the word means in English, "to be called" or "named," and the conjugation chart tells us that it's either conjugated to the first person or third person past. As you read keep both of these possibilities in mind.
* Note that the third word is capitalized, which tells us that it is a proper noun, and some context given to us by the lexical range of _heita_ tells us that [_Auðunn_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Auðunn) is the name of a person. Proper names decline in Old Icelandic and we are lucky enough to find the full declension in the Wiktionary listing where we find that _Auðunn_ is declined to the nominative case. Our verb, _heita_ is what's known as a [copula](https://www.rcblack.net/grammar/copulae/). This is a special kind of verb that communicates the "is-ness" of a noun. In many European languages that decline, the subject and object remain in the nominative case, and that's just what we see here. So, our translation so far looks to be, "[A] man is named Auðun.' This is a formulaic sentence that occurs often in the beginning of narrative episodes in the sagas.
* The rest of the sentence is an adjectival dependent clause. Let's go over it word by word. The word, [vestfirzkr](http://www.germanic-lexicon-project.org/cgi-bin/gmc_search_v3?cmd=viewthis&id=cv:b0700:15) cannot be found in Wiktionary, so we have to resort to using either Zoëga or Cleasby/Vigfusson. The C/V entry is linked here, where we find that it is an adjective to mean someone from the [West Fjords](http://www.germanic-lexicon-project.org/cgi-bin/gmc_search_v3?cmd=viewthis&id=cv:b0700:12) of Iceland. See that "r" at the end of the word? That tells us that it's another nominative masculine adjective, which matches the other nominal words we've already looked at. 
* The word, [at](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/at#Preposition_4) is a preposition that triggers the dative case, which is why the word [kyn](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kyn#Declension_3) (kin, family) has a dative formation. Word order and placement can trigger grammatical case, but so can prepositions. You'll get used to this--I'll talk more about this in a moment.
* The word, [ok](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ok#Etymology_1) is equivalent to English, "and."
* The word, [félitill](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/f%C3%A9#Old_Norse) is a compound word that can be found in Zoëga, but you recognize the particles you can find the adjective, [_lítill_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/l%C3%ADtill#Inflection_2) and it's declensions which tell us that this word also declines nominative. The word, _fé_ means money or wealth, so we know now that Auðun is "small in wealth," or poor.
* Altogether we can see that a good translation for this sentence might be, "a man is named Auðun, [a] Westfjorder, and poor." Note that the Old Icelandic language does not rely on indefinite articles as much as English.

>2\. Hann fór útan vestr þar í fjǫrðum með umbráði þorsteins, búanda góðs, ok þóris stýrimanns, er þar hafði þegit vist of vetrinn með þorsteini.

* Now that we have some experience with the structure of a basic sentence in rest position we can begin to parse the next sentence. [Hann](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hann#Pronoun_3) is in first position and [fór](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fara#Conjugation_3) is in second position, so we know that the first word is the subject and the second word is the verb. Consultation with the dictionaries confirms this pattern. The rest of the sentence consists of adverbial constructions, prepositional constructions, and a relative clause, which we will unpack as we go. 
* _Hann_ is a masculine singular nominative personal pronoun and it refers to our friend Auðunn. The next word, _fór_, is the third person indicative past formation of _fara_. It's worth mentioning here that _fara_, like _heita_, is a strong verb that mutates in the vowel in different conjugations, much like the English verb, _sing_ (sing, sang, sung). The lexical form of verbs is the present third person plural formation, which almost always ends with an "a". Consult the "List of Irregular Forms at the back of Zoëga and look for _fór_. It will tell you the lexical form. So far our translation looks to be, "He went," or "He journeyed."
* The following words, [útan](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/útan) and [vestr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vestr) are both adverbs that mean something like, "westward abroad," or, "out west." The next word, [þar](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%BEar#Old_Norse) is another adverb that means "there." 
* The adverbial component continues with two prepositional phrases. The first is, [í](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/í#Preposition_4) [fjǫrðum](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fjǫrðr#Declension), and means, "in the fjords." [Prepositions](https://www.rcblack.net/grammar/prepositions/) in Old Icelandic and other Germanic languages that decline trigger grammatical cases in the nouns associated with them. In this sentence you can see in the declination chart that this formation is masculine dative plural. So, _í_, triggers the dative case. Now consult the listing for this preposition in Zoëga. The listing is divided into sections that organize it's lexical ranges under, "I. with dat." and, "II. with acc." Generally the accusative usage indicates some kind of active movement (I will put my marble in the box), and the dative case indicates stationary placement (My marble is inside the box).
* The rest of this sentence is another prepositional phrase initiated by the preposition, [með](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/me%C3%B0#Old_Norse), which means something like, "with," or "along with." This preposition also takes either the dative or the accusative, so carefully note the declensions of the upcoming nouns. When translating, also pay close attention to the natural habits of your own language. In English it's common to say, "in the care of..." or, "under the oversight of..."
* If you already tried to look up the word, _umbráði_ ("care," or "oversight) in the dictionaries, you maybe have already had some difficulty. It is actually an alternate spelling of [_umráði_](iwww.germanic-lexicon-project.org/cgi-bin/gmc_search_v3?cmd=viewthis&id=cv:b0651:28) and if the editor were kinder they would have made note of it. An element in this compound word is [_ráð_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/r%C3%A1%C3%B0#Declension_3) and we can see that it is indeed in the dative case. Irregularities like this will be noted.
* [Þórsteinn](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%9Eorsteinn#Declension) is a proper noun, and we can see that it is in the genitive case, indicating possession. "Thorstein's oversight..."
* The next two words are noun, [búanda](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/b%C3%BAandi#Noun), and an adjective, [góðs](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/g%C3%B3%C3%B0r#Old_Norse) that refer to Thorstein. The editor lent a hand by enclosing this in commas. So, here we have a reiterative construction, "...Thorstein, a good farmer,..."
* ...ok [Þóris](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%9E%C3%B3rir) [stýrimanns](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/st%C3%BDrima%C3%B0ur); Another proper noun and a secondary noun that come together to form a compound, "Thorir the Helmsman." Both of these are in the genitive.
* The comma is once again helpful. The word, [er](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/er#Old_Norse) is a relative pronoun or particle that can mean either who, which, or that. _Who_ seems most reasonable.
* er þar hafði þegit vist; Like many relative clauses in English, we find another subject-verb construction where the relative pronoun _er_ operates as the subject of this clause. The verbal component here is [hafði](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hafa#Verb_4) [þegit](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%BEiggja#Old_Norse). Old Icelandic is much like other Germanic languages in that the supine (perfect and pluperfect tenses) is accompanied by an auxiliary verb, _hafa_ (to have). You can see that the auxiliary conjugates to the third person singular past. Look for the supine (perfect) form in the conjugation chart. Also look at the declination chart for the noun, [vist](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vist#Old_Norse). Note that the declension for this feminine noun is noticeably weaker than the declension for _maðr_, where the nominative and accusative forms are the same. In this case you will have to rely on context to find its case. It's a simple direct object so accusative works well here. So, a good translation for the clause might be, "..., who had received (or accepted) lodging there..."
* The clause closes with two short prepositional constructions, [of](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/of#Old_Norse) [vetr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vetr), and _með Þorsteini_, "over the winter with Thorstein." _Vetr_ is another masculine noun, but look at the, "-inn" suffix. You may have already noticed this formation in the other declension charts you've seen. That's the definite article and it can be translated as "the winter." The definite article has it's own declension pattern. See, [-inn](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-inn#Old_Norse). 

>3\. Auðunn var ok þar ok starfaði firir honum Þóri ok þá þessi laun af honum: útanferðina ok hans umsjá.

* Once again this sentence is in a resting form. We can see right away that _Auðunn_ is the subject of the sentence and that it is in the nominative case. Now look at the conjugation of [var](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vera#Conjugation_2). This is the very important copulating verb that translates to English as, "to be." Take some time memorizing this conjugation. It's irregular, but the forms are very similar to formations in other Germanic languages. Since this is another copula verb, the subject and the object will both be in the nominative case.
* We've already seen that _ok_ sometimes means, "and." It can also mean "also." If you know German you know its cognate, _auch_.
* Again, _þar_ means "there."
* Sometimes, _ok_ means "and."
* Did you try looking up the word, [starfaði](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/starfa)? The lexical form of the word is _starfa_. The suffix, _-ði_gives us a hint that this is a weak verb in the first person past tense. Take a look at the conjugation chart. Unlike strong verbs, the weak verbs do not mutate in the root vowel and mark their grammar with a system of suffixes, not unlike most English weak verbs (dance, danced). This word can be translated as, "worked."
* [firir](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fyrir#Preposition_2) [honum](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hann#Declension_3) [Þóri](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%9E%C3%B3rir). This is another prepositional phrase. Note the variant spelling for, _fyrir_. The words, _honum_ and _þóri_, are a pronoun and proper name that refers to the same person in tandem and both are in the dative case triggered by the preposition, _firir_. You will occasionally find this kind of redundancy in Old Icelandic. A good way to translated this might be, "Auðun ... worked for him, Þórir, and ..." or, "He worked for him, that is, Þórir..."
* _ok_ is another conjunction followed by another verb, [þá](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%BEiggja#Verb_2). This is the second time we've seen this verb.
* [þessi](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sj%C3%A1#Declension) [laun](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/laun#Declension_3) The lexical form of _þessi_ is _sjá_. This is the demonstrative pronoun that bears the same function as English _that_. The Icelandic equivalent to the English pronoun _this_ is [sá](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/s%C3%A1#Pronoun_3). The distinction between _this_ and _that_, and _sá_ and _sjá_ is one of proximity. _This_ is close to the narrative action and _that_ is farther away. The word, _laun_ means reward or thing that is to be granted to someone. Both words are in the accusative and are the direct object. "these rewards."
* [af](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/af#Preposition_4) [honum](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hann#Pronoun_3) The word, _af_, is a preposition meaning "from" that activates the dative. We already know that _honum_ is a personal pronoun in the dative case. The function of this prepositional phrase is to indicate an indirect object--"to him."
* [útan](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%BAtan)-[ferðina](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fer%C3%B0#Declension_3) ok [um](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/um#Preposition_9)-[sjá](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sj%C3%A1#Verb_2) These two things are the specific rewards, the _laun_ Audun receives. Both words are compounds of one preposition and one root noun. Each element is linked separately to Wiktionary, so take a look at each one. Most compounds should be represented in Zoega, but if you can't find it, look at the last nominal particle for its declination. The word, _útanferðina_ literally a "journey out" and _umsjá_ means, "his oversight," or in medieval terms, "his patronage." Note the definite article suffixed to _útanferð_.    

>4\. Hann Auðunn lagði mestan hluta fjár þess, er var fyr móður sína, áðr hann stigi á skip, ok var kveðit á þriggja vetra bjǫrg.

* This sentence is is resting form, but notice the nominative masculine personal pronoun, _Hann_ doubled with the nominative proper noun, _Auðunn_. Compare this with, _firir honum Þóri_ in sentence 3.
* [lagði](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/leggja); This is the verb, past tense first person singular, which is still in second position. The lexical form is _leggja_ and is cognate with English, "to lay." compare the Wiktionary definition with my translation in the previous point. The complete usage of many words will not always be covered here, so it's best to rely on your dictionary to get a full account of the word's lexical range. In Zoëga, see definition 9 in which the meaning of the word is to "lay down" money or to pay. Cleasby/Vigfusson has a much more comprehensive entry for [leggja](http://www.germanic-lexicon-project.org/cgi-bin/gmc_search_v3?cmd=viewthis&id=cv:b0379:1). Audun is setting aside money for his elderly mother.
* [mestan](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mestr#Adjective) [hluta](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hlutr); This is the object of this sentence and this is a construction that is common in other Germanic languages. The word, _mestan_ means "most," and _hluta_ means, "parts" or "a portion." Notice that _hluta_ is in the genitive case. This is why we say, "most of" something in English.
* [fjár](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/f%C3%A9#Old_Norse) [þess](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/s%C3%A1#Pronoun_3); The genitive form of the work _fé_ and an accompanying genitive demonstrative article meaning, "that." "The greater part of that money..."
* _er_ [var](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vera#Old_Norse) [fyr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fyrir#Old_Norse) [móður](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/m%C3%B3%C3%B0ir#Old_Norse) [sína](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sinn#Old_Norse); The word, _er_ ,is our relative pronoun acting as the subject of the clause and _var_ is the past tense singular of _vera_, meaning, "to be." The formation _fyr_ is a variant form of _fyrir_, meaning "for." Note the weak declension for _móðir_. The word, _sína_, which has the lexical form, _sinn_, is the possessive pronoun in Old Icelandic. Again, familiarize yourself with its declension. "...which was for his mother."
* [áðr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%A1%C3%B0r) hann [stigi](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/st%C3%ADga#Old_Norse) [á](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%A1#Preposition_3) [skip](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/skip#Old_Norse); The word, _áðr_ is a conjunction meaning, "before." The construction, _hann_ _stigi_ is a subject and verb that means, "he climbed," or "he boarded." The object, _skip_ obviously means ship. So, "before he boarded the ship."
* ok var [kveðit](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kve%C3%B0a#Old_Norse) á [þriggja](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%BEriggja#Old_Norse) [vetra](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vetr) [bjǫrg](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bj%C3%B6rg); Old Icelandic _vera_ is much like English _to be_ in that the copula can function as an auxiliary verb along with a past participle form. "It was decided." The same thing is going on here--_var keviðit_ means, "was proclaimed," or decided." I like, "was arranged..." _Þriggja_ is an ordinal number in the genitive case and _vetra_ is the plural genitive, "winters." The word, _björg_ means, something like "living support," so the passive clause means, "...three winters of support was arranged for," his mother. One orthographic note: See the hooked "ǫ"? That will appear in the dictionaries as an "ö"
	
>5\. Ok nú fara þeir út heðan, ok fersk þeim vel, ok var Auðunn of vetrinn eptir með Þóri stýrimanni--hann átti bú á Mœri.

* Ok [nú](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/n%C3%BA#Old_Norse) [fara](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fara#Old_Norse) [þeir](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hann#Old_Norse) [út](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%BAt#Icelandic) [heðan](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/h%C3%A9%C3%B0an#Old_Norse); The pronoun, _þeir_, is the nominative plural subject of this sentence. Unlike the previous sentences, this one is not in resting position, that is, with its nominative subject in first position. What we have here is a conjunctive particle followed by an adverb before the verb, _fara_. 

<!--
This is one of the reasons why English is not a V2 language. Compare these two sentences:
	* We dance under the full moon.
	* Under the full moon, we dance.
	
	In this example, the syntax of English keeps the verb after the subject even when the sentence begins with a prepositional phrase. This is one of the reasons why comma placement is so important in English. In Old Icelandic, the additional material displaces the subject out of first position after the verb, but the verb stays in second position and the prepositional phrase occupies first position. Here is what what the above sentences would look like in Old Icelandic:	
	* Vér dǫnzum undir tunglinu.
	* Undir tunglinu, dǫnzum vér.
-->	

The first two words can be translated as, "and now," but a more comfortable and idiomatic way of saying this might be, "so now..." As you can see, _þeir_ is a nominative plural pronoun and the subject. The verb, _fara_ is the present tense plural of the word that means, "to go." Note that tense will often continually shift in the medieval language. _út heðan_ simply means, "out hither" or "away." For some reason there's a lot of nautical terms in this literature, so don't be afraid to use them when you translate. "Sail" is a decent translation for _fara_. So, I might translate this, "and now they sail away..."
* ok [fersk](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fara#Conjugation_3) þeim [vel](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vel#Old_Norse); Take a close look at this verb. To find the conjugation you need to click on the "mediopassive" block. Some texts call this kind of verb, "middle voice," but this kind of Old Icelandic verb also includes a passive function, so, "medio-passive" is used here. In our usage, this verb is reflexive, "they travelled themselves well." English lost much of its reflexive functions in the Norman period, so we can just translate this as, "They travelled well," or "safely." You can also find the mediopassive _fara_ to mean, "it went well." I would accept that translation too. We will talk about the mediopassive in greater detail in class.
* ok var Auðunn [of](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/of#Old_Norse) vetrinn [eptir](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/eptir) með Þóri stýrimanni; We've seen most of these words before. See if you can translate it yourself.
* Hann [átti](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/eiga#Conjugation_2) [bú](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/b%C3%BA#Noun_2) á Mœri; The double hyphen placed by the editor at the end of this is telling, and it does act like an afterthought. This is about Thorir, who had a farm (bú) in [Mœri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B8re_og_Romsdal), a district in Norway.

>6\. Ok um sumarit eptir fara þeir út til Grœnlands, ok eru þar of vetrinn.

* This sentence is straightforward. The syntax is much like the last sentence, in that it begins with prepositional phrase, _um sumarit eftir_, which altogether occupies first position. The verb follows in second position, _fara_.
* [þeir](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ek#Old_Norse); A prounoun, and the subject of the sentence.
* [sumarit](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sumar#Noun_5); "during the course of the summer..."
* [til](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/til#Preposition_10) Grœnlands; Some Old Icelandic prepositions activate the genitive case, so _Grœnlands_ has a genitive ending.
* [of](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/of#Preposition_5); "over" works here. But also, "over the course of..."

>7\. Þess er við getit, at Auðunn kaupir þar bjarndýri eitt, gjǫrsimi mikla, ok gaf þar firir alla eigu sína.

* [þess](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/s%C3%A1#Pronoun_3) [er](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vera#Verb_4) [við](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vi%C3%B0#Preposition_3) [getit](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/geta#Verb_2), [at](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/at#Conjunction_6); _þess_ is the genitive singular demonstrative meaning, "that." _geta við_ is a very idiomatic way of saying, "to speak about." You can find these idioms deep in the dictionary entries. They are in there, so please be patient. The word, _at_ is a conjunction that can be translated as, "that." So, from this we have, "Of this, it is said, that..."
* The rest of the sentence is straightforward. _Auðunn_ is the subject and [kaupir](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kaupa#Old_Norse) is the verb--note the present tense.
* The next word, _þar_ is our adjective that means, "there."
* [bjarn](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bj%C7%ABrn#Old_Norse)[dýr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/d%C3%BDr#Old_West_Norse)-[eitt](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/einn#Pronoun_2); The word, _eitt_, is a numeric adjective that means here one, or an emphatic indefinite article, like English "a," or, "one" ("one bear," "a bear"). The word, _bjarn-dýri_, is a compound noun that transliterates as, "bear-animal," the _dýr_ part being the generic word for any non-fish animal (medieval taxonomy is a little different). So, Audunn, "bought a bear," when he went to Greenland. This would have been a polar bear.
* [gjǫrsimi](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gersemi) [mikla](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gersemi); Notice how the adjectives follow their nouns. The bear is a "great treasure," meaning that it was very expensive.
* ok [gaf](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gefa#Verb_2) þar firir [alla](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/allr) [eigu](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/eiga#Verb_4) [sína](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sinn#Old_Norse); he gave away everything he had for the bear.

>8\. Ok nú of sumarit eptir þá, fara þeir aptr til Nóregs ok verða vel reiðfara.

* Ok nú of sumarit eptir [þá](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%BE%C3%A1#Old_Norse); _Ok nú_ is another "and now."
* [verða vel reiðfara](http://www.germanic-lexicon-project.org/cgi-bin/gmc_search_v3?cmd=viewthis&id=cv:b0489:12); From here on I will start linking some entries to the _Icelandic-English Dictionary_ by Richard Cleasby and Gudbrand Vigfusson. This has been a valuable tool for English speakers for more than a century. You can also find this idiom listed in Zoëga if you look for _reiðfara_. Do not be shy about consulting either of these dictionaries and spend some time carefully reading the entries. There's much valuable information in them.

>9\. Hefir Auðunn dýr sitt með sér, ok ætlar nú at fara suðr til Danmerkr á fund Sveins konungs, ok gefa honum dýrit.

* [Hefir](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hafa#Old_Norse) Auðunn; This sentence appears to be anomalous to the V2 rule, and that sometimes happens sometimes for style or emphasis. Nevertheless, the nominative subject should be easy for you to find.
* dýr [sitt](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sinn#Old_Norse) með [sér](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/s%C3%A9r); The word, _sitt_, is a possessive pronoun, so "his animal." _sér_ is a reflexive pronoun, which would translate to English as "himself." So the entire clause would transliterate as, "Audun has his animal with himself." I would translate this as, "Audun took his animal with him." Reflexives are weaker in English and, "took" falls under the lexical range of _hafa_. 
* [ætlar](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%A6tla#Old_Norse)...at fara...[gefa](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gefa#Old_Norse); This is the verbal component of this sentence. Take a look at _ætlar_. This is present tense singular verb that means, "intends, or, "plans." Just like English, this verb can function as an auxiliary verb followed by another verb in the infinitive form. For example, in "Audun intends to go south," "intends" is the auxiliary verb that is followed by the infinitive, "to go." The infinitive, [gefa](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gefa#Old_Norse) is also connected to _ætlar_. So, "he planned to so south..., and give him..." 

>10\. Ok er hann kom suðr í landit þar sem konungr var firir, þá gengr hann upp af skipi, ok leiðir eptir sér dýrit, ok leigir sér herbergi.

* Okay, so let's spend some time looking at the overall architecture of this sentence. Look at the first words of the first two clauses, _Ok_ [er](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/er#Conjunction_4), and [þá](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%BE%C3%A1#Old_Norse). We've already seen _er_ function as a relative pronoun. In this position it operates as an adverb meaning, "when." We already know that _þá_ means, "then." So this sentence uses the chronological construction, "And when (the first thing happened), then (this other thing happened).
* [þar sem](http://www.germanic-lexicon-project.org/cgi-bin/gmc_search_v3?cmd=viewthis&id=cv:b0730:13); Together these two words usually mean, "where."
* Again, _firir_=[fyriri](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fyrir#Old_Norse); "before" in a temporal sense. "Already" works also.
* [gengr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ganga#Old_Norse) hann [upp](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/upp#Old_Norse) af [skipi](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/skip#Declension_3); Note that the proposition _af_ activates the dative case.
* [leiðir](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lei%C3%B0a#Old_Norse) eptir sér dýrit; Note the reflexive pronoun, _sér_. He leads the animal behind himself.
* [leigir](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/leiga#Old_Norse); "rented." He checks in at an inn.
* [herbergi](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/herbergi#Old_Norse); lodging at an inn. A weak noun in the accusative case.

>11\. Haraldi konungi var sagt brátt, at þar var komit bjarndýri, gørsimi mikil, ok á íslenzkr maðr.

* [Haraldi](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Haraldur) [konungi](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/konungr); Be careful with this sentence! It might appear that the sentence is in resting position, but note that the name and title in first position is in the dative case. _Haraldi konungi_ is an indirect object.
* var [sagt](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/segja#Old_Norse) [brátt](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/br%C3%A1tt); The word, _sagt_ is a participle formation that works together with the auxiliary copula, _var_. Compare this with how English constructs the passive voice, "He was immediately informed, that..." English "was" and past participle "informed" form the passive voice. This Icelandic sentence uses a cognate formation.
* [at](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/at#Conjunction_6); "that." A conjunction that introduces the following subordinate clause.
* var [komit](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/koma#Verb_6): "did arrive." Compare this with the previous clause.
* Note the grammatical case of bjarn[dýri](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/d%C3%BDr#Old_West_Norse).
* [á](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%A1#Etymology_7); Preposition that activates the dative, "with."
* [íslenzkr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%ADslenskur#Icelandic) maðr; Again, note the Grammatical case.

>12\. Konungr sendir þegar menn eptir honum, ok er Auðunn kom firir konung, kveðr hann konung vel.

* Our vocabulary is starting to fill in! We've already seen most of these words. This sentence is in resting position and the clauses are straightforward. Look at the previous sentences if you cannot remember the lexical form. If you haven't already, start using Zoëga or C/V.
* [þegar](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%BEegar#Old_Norse); "right away," or "immediately."
* [honum](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hann#Pronoun_3)
* [kveðr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kve%C3%B0ja#Old_Norse): "welcomes."

>13\. Konungr tók vel kveðju hans, ok spurði síðan:

* [tók](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/taka#Verb_4)
* [kveðju](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kve%C3%B0ja#Noun_2); This is the noun form of the word.
* [spurði](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/spyrja#Old_Norse): "asked."

>14\. "Áttu gjǫrsimi mikla í bjarndýri?"

* [Áttu](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/eiga#Verb_4); This word is a little tricky. The word is indeed _eiga_, but the _áttu_ you see in the chart is not what you're looking for--it's just a coincidence. The formation in our sentence is a vocative contraction that looks like this when spelled out: átt [þú](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hann#Pronoun_3). "You have" or in an interrogative statement, "have you?"
* [í](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%AD#Preposition_4)

>14\. Hann svarar, ok kvezk eiga dýrit eitthvert.

* [kvezk](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%AD#Preposition_4) eiga; Note the mediopassive form. The mediopassive sense of of this word has a sense that he, "said for himself." "Proclaimed works well too, but it's also an auxiliary. He "said to have..." A natural way to say this in English would be to expand this into a "that" clause. "He explained __that__ he had..."
* [eitthvert](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/einnhverr); "some kind of."

>15\. Konungr mælti, "Villtu selja oss dýrit við slíku verði sem þú keyptir?"

* [mælti](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/m%C3%A6la#Old_Norse)
* [Villtu](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vilja#Verb_2); Another vocative contraction.
* [selja](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/selja#Verb_4)
* [oss](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hann#Declension_3): First person plural. This is literally the royal "we."
* [slíku](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sl%C3%ADkur); "such." The Old Icelandic page for _slíkr_ is not available. Note the differences in spelling.
* [verði](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ver%C3%B0r#Etymology_2); "worth," or "value."
* [sem](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sem#Old_Norse); "as." So, "such value as..."
* [keyptir](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kaupa#Verb_2); Yes this means, "to buy," but this can also mean to bargain for or do decide, in this case the price of the bear.

>16\. Hann svaraði, "Eigi vil ek þat, herra."

* [svaraði](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/svara#Old_Norse); "answered."
* [Eigi](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/eigi#Etymology_2); This is different from the verb, _eiga_. This is the negating adverb that mean, "not." So, he does not want something.
* [herra](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/herra#Old_Norse); "lord," or "my lord."

>17\. "Villtu þá," sagði konungr, "at ek gefa þér tvau verð slík, ok mun þat réttari, ef þú hefir þar við gefit alla þína eigu?"

* [þér](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hann#Pronoun_3); Second person singular personal pronoun. Dative case, indirect object.
* [tvau](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tveir#Old_Norse) [verð](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ver%C3%B0r#Adjective) [slík](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sl%C3%ADkur); "...two [times] such" or, "double of such value."
* [mun](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/munu#Verb_2); The modal verb, _munu_. This generally functions as an auxiliary verb that accompanies another verb in the infinitive form. It can be translated as, "will," or "shall."
* [þat](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/s%C3%A1#Old_Norse)
* [réttara](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/r%C3%A9ttr#Old_Norse); An adjective with a comparative adjective suffix. Note that the lexical form is _réttr_, "right." The _-ari_ suffix allows us to translate it as, "more right," or "more just."
* [ef](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ef#Conjunction_3); conjunction, "if."
* [hafir](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hafa#Verb_4); Second person singular subjunctive past. Although the conjunction is weak, we can surmise the voice through context.
* [við gefit](http://lexicon.ff.cuni.cz/html/oi_cleasbyvigfusson/b0194.html); to give in payment.
* [eigu](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/eiga#Noun_4); "...all of his possessions."

>18\. "Eigi vil ek þat, herra," sagði hann.

* You've got this.

>19\. Konungr mælti, "Villtu gefa mér þá?"

* You're doing great!

>20\. Hann svaraði, "Eigi, herra."

>21\. Konungr mælti, "Hvat villtu þá af gjǫra?"

* [Hvat](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hvat#Old_Norse); "what."
* [af](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/af#Preposition_4) [gjǫra](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gera#Icelandic); "to do." "Then what do you wish to do 'with all this?'"

>22\. Hann svaraði, "Fara," segir hann, "til Danmerkr ok gefa Sveini konungi."

* :thumbsup:

>23\. Haraldr konungr sagði: "Hvárt er, at þú ert maðr svá óvitr, at þú hefir eigi heyrt ófrið þann, er í milli er landa þessa, eða ætlar þú giptu þína svá mikla, at þú munir þar komask með gjǫrsimar, er aðrir fá eigi komizk klakklaust, þó at nauðsyn eigi til?"

* [Hvárt](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hv%C3%A1rr) er...[eða](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/e%C3%B0a); "Which is it? That you...or is it that...," or, "Is it that you are...or..."
* [svá](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sv%C3%A1#Old_Norse) [óvitr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vitr); "So unwise." notice the "ó" in the second word. That´s the negative prefix that is cognate with the English prefix, "un-." In most modern editions this negative particle appears as an "ó" but in Zoëga and Cleasby/Vigfusson you will find it under "ú."
* [heyrt](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/heyra#Old_Norse)
* [ófrið](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%BAfri%C3%B0r)
* [landa](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/land#Old_Norse)
* [giptu](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gifta#Noun)
* [munir](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/munu#Old_Norse) [komask](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/munu#Old_Norse); The mediopassive sense is, "to manage to get through," or, "to get by." You can even translate this as, "to survive."
* er [aðrir](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/annarr#Old_Norse) [fá](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/f%C3%A1r#Old_Norse); "while few others." Note the masculine plural declension of the pronoun. _fá_ takes the weak adjective ending because the strong ending is already expressed by _aðrir_. The weak ending is used when another adjective or article expresses a strong ending.
* [klakklaust](http://www.germanic-lexicon-project.org/cgi-bin/gmc_search_v3?cmd=viewthis&id=cv:b0341:35)
* [þó at](http://www.germanic-lexicon-project.org/cgi-bin/gmc_search_v3?cmd=viewthis&id=cv:b0742:15); "although." From Cleasby/Vigfusson. Look at entry B.
* [eigi](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/eiga#Old_Norse)
* [nauðsyn](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nau%C3%B0syn); "need." A requirement to do something.
* [til](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/til#Preposition_10); When you see a preposition alone like this, unconnected to a noun, connect it with the verb. Some verbs reserve some of it's lexical range accompanied by certain prepositions, much like English, " to clean up." These are most often listed in the dictionaries, either in the verb's listing or the preposition. IN this case the preposition _til_ adds a meaning of agency to the verb, much like English, "...have to (do something).
