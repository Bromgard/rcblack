# Nominal Gender and declension

## The Icelandic noun in practice

Now that we know how the four declensions work, let's take a look at how they work int he Old Icelandic language. Let's revisit the declension paradigm for _konungr_.

Case | Singular | Plural
-----------------|----------|--------
Nominative       | konungr  | konungar
Accusative	     | konung   | konunga
Dative           | konungi  | konungum
Genitive         | konungs  | konunga

Now let's look at what these declensions look like in real Old Icelandic sentences.

>Konungr tók vel kveðju hans. (The king took his greeting well.)

Look for the case ending for the nominative case. Whenever you see this suffixed strong ending, you know that you have found a nominative singular strong noun. The king is the agent that is performing the action of the verb, _tók_. Now that we know the grammatical paradigm for _konungr_, we can spot the grammatical case when we find the word elsewhere in our reading. 

>Þú hafir fundit Svein konung. (You have met King Svein.)

What case is _konungr_ in this sentence? Here, the subject (nominative) is _þú_ and is in first position. The verbal construction is _havir fundit_, which is in second position. _Svein konung_ is the object of the sentence, so the noun takes the appropriate ending, which in this case is none at all. The singular accusative case is our only option.

>Varðmenn sǫgðu konungi at dýrit fari þar. (The watchmen said to the king that the animal is coming there.

In this sentence, _konungi_ adopts the dative case ending. _Varðmenn_ is the subject and _sǫgðu_ is the verb in second position. The word, _konungi_ is the indirect object taking the dative case. The watchmen told the news _to_ the king.

## The Suffixed Definite Article

If you already know a Scandinavian language, then you are already acquainted with the suffixed definite article. The English definite article, _the_, does not decline and always precedes the accompanying noun. In Scandinavian languages, the definite article performs very much the same function, but appears as an additional particle suffixed to the accompanying noun. Let's take another look at the Swedish noun, _konung_, this time with the suffixed article.

Case | Sing.    | Sing. Definite | Plural   | Plural Definite
-----------------|----------|----------------|----------|----------------
Nominative       | konung   | konungen       | konungar | konungarna
Genitive	 | konungs  | konungens      | konungars| konungarnas

The rules governing this paradigm are easy to parse. The articles are suffixed to reflect the needed case and number. The genitive enclitic, _-s_ always appears at he end of the word even when the suffixed article is present.

The Old Icelandic definite article likewise follows a stronger declension that also reflects the grammatical cases. 

| Case &nbsp; | Sing. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Sing. Def. &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural Def.|
|:-----|:---------|:-----------|:---------|:------------|
| Nom. | konungr  | konungrinn | konungar | konungarnir |
| Acc. | konung   | konunginn  | konunga  | konungana   |
| Dat. | konungi  | konunginum | konungum | konungunum  |
| Gen. | konungs  | konungsins | konunga  | konunganna  |

Notice that the construction of the case endings along with the definite article is very regular. Note the particles that make up the definite noun, _konungrinn_:

| Stem  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| Case Suffix &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| Def. Article |
|:--------|:------------:|:-------------|
| konung- | -r          | -inn         |

When the noun appears in the nominative case, the _-r_ ending is always present after the stem, even when the definite suffix is also present.

>Konungrinn leit eptir honum. (The king looked him over.)

The presence of the _-r_ in _konungrinn_ tells you that the king in this sentence is unambiguously the agent of the action and in the nominative case. Compare this sentence with the following exchange. 

>Bolli spyrr: "Hvat viltu gera?" (Bolli asks him, "What will you do?")
>
>"Ekki mun ek því leyna," segir Kjartan, "brenna konunginn inni." ("I will not hide this from you," says Kjartan, "To burn the king inside.)

In this formation, since _konunginn_ does not contain the nominative ending _-r_, we know that the word is in the accusative case and therefore the object of _brenna_. The king is the object of Kjartan's intent to ignite his quarters and murder him in his sleep. Don't worry. The king was keeping his eye on him.

## Strong Nouns

Old Icelandic noun declensions are generically classed into three genders, masculine, feminine, and neuter. Each gender is likewise organized into strong strong and weak declensions which altogether make six total declension patterns.

The categories do share some affinities with social gender. This is why early grammarians in the antique tradition coined the use of gendered categories when they codified the patterns in Latin and Greek.

Gender | Ice. | Eng.
-------|------|------
Fem.   | kona | woman
Masc.  | karl | man
Neut.  | barn | child

However it is very important to remember that grammatical gender has very little to do with social gender. For our purposes, grammatical gender is best understood as systemic patterns that can be used organize the nominal declensions of Old Icelandic nouns and adjectives. 

The declension pattern of _konungr_ will look much like the declension patterns of many other masculine nouns. Remember _konungr_?

| Case &nbsp; | Sing. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Sing. Def. &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural Def.|
|:-----|:---------|:-----------|:---------|:------------|
| Nom. | konungr  | konungrinn | konungar | konungarnir |
| Acc. | konung   | konunginn  | konunga  | konungana   |
| Dat. | konungi  | konunginum | konungum | konungunum  |
| Gen. | konungs  | konungsins | konunga  | konunganna  |

Let's take a look at the declension of the strong, neuter noun, _dýr_ (animal). 

| Case &nbsp; | Sing. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Sing. Def. &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural Def.|
|:-----|:-----|:--------|:------|:--------|
| Nom. | dýr  | dýrit   | dýr   | dýrin   |
| Acc. | dýr  | dýrit   | dýr   | dýrin   |
| Dat. | dýri | dýrinu  | dýrum | dýrunum |
| Gen. | dýrs | dýrsins | dýra  | dýrana  |

Compare the differences. In the indefinite formations, the nominative and accusative cases in both singular and plural lose their distinctions. The terminal 'm' is lost in the article formation in dative singular, but the rest of the formations retain the same pattern. The neuter class is expressed in the distinct formations in the suffixed definite article, _-it, -inu_.

Now let's take a look and the declension of the strong, feminine noun, _ferð_ (journey).

| Case &nbsp; | Sing. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Sing. Def. &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural Def.|
|:-----|:---------|:------------|:-------|:---------|
| Nom. | ferð     | ferðin      | ferðir | ferðinar |
| Acc. | ferð     | ferðina     | ferðir | ferðinar |
| Dat. | ferð     | ferðinni    | ferðum | ferðunum |
| Gen. | ferðar   | ferðarinnar | ferða  | ferðanna |

As you can see, the only distinct formation in singular indefinite is the genitive case (much like in English). The plural indefinite formations are more like strong masculine nouns in that they distinguish themselves from the singular in the nominative and accusatives cases with the _-ir_ suffix.

## Weak Declensions

The reason we call the declensions of the above nouns strong is because they communicate strong information about their grammatical case. The weak nouns are called so because they communicate weak grammatical information in their formations. Take a look at the following weak nouns:

### Weak Masculine, _tími_ (time)

| Case &nbsp; | Sing. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Sing. Def. &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural Def.|
|:-----|:---------|:-----------|:---------|:------------|
| Nom. | tími | tíminn  | tímar | tímarnir |
| Acc. | tíma | tímann  | tíma  | tímana   |
| Dat. | tíma | tímanum | tímum | tímunum  |
| Gen. | tíma | tímans  | tíma  | tímanna  |

### Weak Neuter, _auga_ (eye)

| Case &nbsp; | Sing. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Sing. Def. &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural Def.|
|:-----|:-----|:-------|:------|:---------|
| Nom. | auga | augat  | augu  | augun    |
| Acc. | auga | augat  | augu  | augun    |
| Dat. | auga | auganu | augum | augunum  |
| Gen. | auga | augans | augna | augnanna |


### Weak Feminine, _tunga_ (tongue, language)

| Case &nbsp; | Sing. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Sing. Def. &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural Def.|
|:-----|:---------|:-----------|:---------|:------------|
| Nom. | tunga  | tungan    | tungur  | tungurnar |
| Acc. | tungu  | tunguna   | tungur  | tungurnar |
| Dat. | tungu  | tungunni  | tungum  | tungunum  |
| Gen. | tungu  | tungunnar | tungna  | tunganna  |

As you can see these declinations are generally weaker than the strong nouns, particularly in the indefinite singular formations. When used the suffixed definite article relays information about the noun's gender and grammatical case. In all cases, if the noun's formation doesn't communicate information, look to the other words in the sentence for help, refer to reading context. 

Note the regularity of the patterns in dative and genitive plural. The strong _-m_ in the dative plural formations will always save you some time!

### Strong Masculine

Altogether we can assemble the following general patterns for the case endings of Old Icelandic nouns.

| Case | Sing | Plural |
|:-----|:----:|:-------|
| Nom. |  -r  |  -ar or ir  |
| Acc. |  --  |  -a, -i, or -u |
| Dat. | -i or -- | -um | 
| Gen. | -s or -ar| -a  |

|:-----|:----:|:-------|
| Nom. |  -i  |  -ar   |
| Acc. |  -a  |  -a    |
| Dat. |  -a  |  -um   | 
| Gen. |  -a  |  -a    |

### Strong Neuter

| Acc. |  --  |  -ar or ir |
| Dat. |  --  |  -um   | 
| Gen. |  -ar | -a     |

### Weak Feminine

| Case | Sing | Plural |
|:-----|:----:|:-------|
| Nom. |  -a  |  -ur   |
| Acc. |  -u  |  -ur   |
| Dat. |  -u  |  -um   | 
| Gen. |  -u  |  -na   |

## How to use the dictionary

The noun paradigms offered in the above lesson and outlined in Aleric's sheet are good rules-of-thumb you can use to reference while you begin reading your first texts. Zoega's concise dictionary also contains a very handy reference grammar as well. However, be aware that there are many exceptions to these rules. Some resources break down the nouns into even more categories (which are expressed in the variant patterns in these charts). Others organize the noun paradigms based on reconstructed relationships uncovered by historical comparative linguists. I believe the simplest course of action is to simply learn the attributes of each noun as you build your vocabulary. When you memorize a noun, be mindful of the noun's gender and it's pattern of declension.
