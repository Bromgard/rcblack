# The Copula

## The Substantive Copula

The word, _copula_, is a Latin word that translates into English to mean a harness, leash, or some kind of connecting rope or bond. Grammarians adopted the word to also describe the verb, _sum_, the Latin word that is best translated into English as _to be_, or _is_. Let's take a look at this simple sentence:

>Hope is the thing with feathers.

The subject of this sentence is "hope," and the verb is the word, "is." But, "the thing with feathers," is not he object of the sentence. It does not receive the action of, "hope." In fact there is no action at all, it's simply the same thing. If you switch the two items,

>The thing with feathers is hope.

It means exactly the same thing. In this case the item that follows the verb is called the _subject compliment_. In reality, the predicate construction is simply a way to adjectivally describe the subject. The compliment can also be an adjectival prepositional phrase.

>Love is in the air, everywhere I look around.

The conjugation of _be_, or _is_ in English is as follows:

| Person | Present | Past |
|:-------|:-------:|-----:|
| Sg. 1  | am      | was  |
| Sg. 2  | are     | were |
| Sg. 3  | is      | was  |
| Pl. 1,2,3  | are     | were |

If you already know a Scandinavian language you already know that the indicative conjugation for the copula has been reduced by number so that the only forms remaining are _er_ in the present case and _var_ for the past (_är_ and _var_ in Swedish). 

In many languages that decline such as Latin, German, and Old Icelandic, the grammatical case is always the nominative on both sides of the copula. Look at the following popular German Sentence:

>__Ich__ bin __ein Berliner__. (I am a Berliner.)

_Ich_ is the personal pronoun meaning, "I" and _bin_ is the German copula that means "am." The subjuctival compliment is the rest of the sentence, "a Berliner." Both "ich" and "ein Berliner," A noun that means a resident of Berlin preceded by the indefinite article, are both in the nominative case. This will likewise always be the case whenever you see the Old Icelandic copula. The substantive verb, _vera_ conjugates like this. (Compare this with the archaic English construction, _thou art_.)

### Indicative

| Person | Present | Past |
|:-------|:-------:|-----:|
| Sg. 1  | em      | var  |
| Sg. 2  | ert     | vart |
| Sg. 3  | er      | var  |
| Pl. 1  | erum    | várum|
| Pl. 2  | eruð    | váruð|
| Pl. 3  | eru     | váru |

### Subjunctive 

| Person | Present | Past |
|:-------|:-------:|-----:|
| Sg. 1  | sé      | væra |
| Sg. 2  | sér     | værir|
| Sg. 3  | sé      | væri |
| Pl. 1  | sém     | værim|
| Pl. 2  | séð     | værið|
| Pl. 3  | sé      | væri |

Take a look at the following sentence from Olaf's saga Trygvasson:

>__Ek__ em útlendr __maðr__ hér, segir hann. (I am a foreign man here.)

The substantive copula here is _em_. The subject is the pronoun, _ek_, and the identifying compliment noun is _maðr_. Note that _ek_ is the nominative singular pronoun. The Old Icelandic noun, _maðr_ is a strong masculine noun in its singular nominative formation. The verb formation is likewise in agreement with the nominal formation in the sentence in that it relays the singular present tense. Make note of the strong masculine nominative inflexion in the adjective, _útlendr_. Like the examples above, the substantive construction links the subject with itself by simply describing a equivalence by linking _ek_ and _útlandr maðr_. 

Now take a look at the following sentence from a genealogy from _Landnámabók_:

>__Sonr__ Bjǫrnólfs var __Ǫrn__, __faðir__ þeira Ingólfs ok Helgu, en __Hróaldsson__ var __Hróðmarr__, __faðir__ Leifs. (The son of Bjornolf was Orn, the father of Ingolf and Helgi, but Hroald's son was Hrothmar, Leif's father.)

The substantive copula in this sentence is of course, _var_, which occurs twice in in this compound sentence that is linked by the conjunction, _en_. The words that are in the nominative case are indicated. The words, _sonr_ and _faðir_  both contain strong nominative formations. (Hyperlink to declension of _faðir_?) In order to parse the rest of the sentence, it's useful to know something about how the proper names decline. _Ǫrn_ is a proper name that means "Eagle," a word that declines like this:

| Case | Noun |
|:-----|-----:|
| Nom. | Ǫrn  |
| Acc. | Ǫrn  |
| Dat. | Erni |
| Gen. | Arnar|

You can easily exclude both the dative and genitive cases but we know that noun compliment _faðir_ is in the nominative case. _Hróðmarr_ is also in the nominative case. (Link. See Declension of Old Icelandic proper names.) You may have noticed that the patronymic name _Hróaldsson_ does not appear to agree with the earlier incidence of _sonr_ which contains a strong masculine nominative ending. In many modern editions and in the manuscripts, one will often find the patronymic ending separately like this: _Hróalds son_, but nevertheless this suffixed occurrence of _son_ lost the strong ending _-r_ by the time this manuscript was written. In this example, _Hróaldsson_ is nevertheless also in the nominative case. His complete name is, _Hróðmarr Hróaldsson_. (Is this interesting or too complicated?)

## Other Copular Verbs

There are other verbs in Old Icelandic that act like the substantive copula. A version of the following sentence occurs in nearly every Icelandic saga.

>__Oddr__ hét __maðr__. (A man is named Oddr.)

The verb, _hét_, lexical form, _heita_, is actually difficult to translate directly into English because the word fell out of common usage and has since resorted to a passive construction that communicates that the subject was named by someone at some point in their lives. The verb acts very much like _vera_ in the above examples. The word, _Oddr_, contains a strong nominative compliment that is in agreement with _maðr_. As you can see, the verb links the two nominal formations in a similar fashion to _vera_.
