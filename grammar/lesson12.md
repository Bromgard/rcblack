# The copula verbs and the substantive

## The substantive (fix this) 

The word, _copula_, is a Latin word that translates into English to mean a harness, leash, or some kind of connecting rope or bond. Grammarians adopted the word to also describe the verb, _sum_, the Latin word that is best translated into English as _to be_, or _is_. Let's take a look at this simple sentence:

>Hope is the thing with feathers.

The subject of this sentence is obviously "hope," and the verb is the word, "is." But, "the thing with feathers," is not he object of the sentence. It does not receive the action of, "hope." In fact there is no action at all, it's simply the same thing. If you switch the two items,

>The thing with feathers is hope.

It means exactly the same thing. In this case the item that follows the verb is called the _subject compliment_. In reality, the predicate construction is simply a way to adjectivally describe the subject. The compliment can also be an adjectival prepositional phrase.

>Love is in the air, everywhere I look around.

The conjugation of _be_, or _is_ in English is as follows:

| Person | Present | Past |
|:-------|:-------:|-----:|
| Sg. 1  | am      | was  |
| Sg. 2  | are     | were |
| Sg. 3  | is      | was  |
| Pl. 1,2,3  | are     | were |

In many languages that decline such as Latin, German, and Old Icelandic, the grammatical case is always the nominative on both sides of the copula. Look at the following popular German Sentence:

>Ich bin ein Berliner. (I am a Berliner.)

_Ich_ is the personal pronoun meaning, "I" and _bin_ is the German copula that means "am." The subjuctival compliment is the rest of the sentence, "a Berliner." Both "ich" and "ein Berliner" are both in the nominative case. This will likewise always be the case whenever you see the "be" verb in Old Icelandic. The Old Icelandic substantive verb conjugates like this. 

### Indicative
