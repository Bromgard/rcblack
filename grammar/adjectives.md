# Adjectives in Old Icelandic

## Proto-Indo-European Modifiers

The Proto-Indo-European noun was modified by three different conditional constructions:

1) By means of a construction of a coupling (a pattern that would later become many compound nouns) with another noun.

_Stone Roses_, _Mushroomhead_, _Sex Pistols_

2) By means of the genitive case.

_Jane's Addiction, Mary's Danish, Herman's Hermits_

3) Dedicated noun modifiers. The Proto-Indo-European adjective is a familiar part of speech that specifies a specific quality belonging to the accompanying noun. These adjectives had their own system of grammatical declension which may have been inherited from an older system of nominal genitives (or some other grammatical case). In PIE, the adjectives likewise decline to agree with its accompanying noun.

_Green Day, Twisted Sister, Fleet Foxes._

Just as in contemporary speech, there is overlap between these categories. Nouns may easily function as adjectives and vice versa.

Because of this natural overlap, it is possible that before the reconstructed phase of Indo-European development, adjectives and nouns shared the same declensions. However there is evidence in the reconstructed PIE, that the distinction between natural nouns and adjectives, and their declensions were becoming more distinct from each other. In modern Indo-European languages that retain a system of declension, adjectives and nouns as they function grammatically in the grammar bear their own idiomatic systems of declension. The grammatical case ending of the noun must agree with the grammatical case ending of its accompanying adjective.  

## Declension of Adjectives in Old Icelandic

There are two declensions in Old Icelandic, the strong and the weak.

### Strong Declension

#### Singular

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | langr     | lǫng     | langt
Acc. | langan    | langa    | langt
Dat. | lǫngum    | langri   | lǫngu
Gen. | langs     | langrar  | langs

#### Plural

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | langir     | langar  | lǫng
Acc. | langa     | langar   | lǫng
Dat. | lǫngum    | lǫngum   | lǫngum
Gen. | langra     | langra  | langra

#### Singular

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | gamall     | gǫmul     | gamalt
Acc. | gamlan    | gamla    | gamalt
Dat. | gǫmlum    | gamalli   | gǫmlu
Gen. | gamals     | gamallar  | gamals

#### Plural

Acc. | gamla     | gamlar   | gǫmul
Dat. | gǫmlum    | gǫmlum   | gǫmlum
Gen. | gamalla     | gamalla  | gamalla

The declension of _annarr_ is interesting. It also always takes the strong declension.

#### Singular

Acc. | aðra     | aðrar   | ǫnnur
Dat. | ǫðrum    | ǫðrum  | ǫðrum
Gen. | annarra     | annarra  | annarra

### The Weak Declension

#### Singular

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | langi     | langa     | langa
Acc. | langa    | lǫngu    | langa
Dat. | langa    | lǫngu   | langa
Gen. | langa     | lǫngu  | langa

#### Plural

-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | lǫngu     | lǫngu  | lǫngu
Acc. | lǫngu     | lǫngu   | lǫngu
Dat. | lǫngum    | lǫngum   | lǫngum
Gen. | lǫngu     | lǫngu  | lǫngu

### Adjective usage in Old Icelandic

The usage of the strong and weak declensions is largely consistent with their usage in modern German. When standing alone as a modifier to a noun, the adjective always takes the strong ending.

> __Eiríkr alspakr__ hét __lendr maðr__ í Nóregi. ([A] landed man is named Eirík All-wise.)
<!--_Egla_, chapt. 64-->

This sentence contains two simple noun-adjective pairs, __Eiríkr alspakr__, and __lendr maðr__. The word, _lendr_ is and adjective that carries the strong nominative adjective ending in parallel with _maðr_ and the other moun-adjective pairing, _Eiríkr alspakr_, that begins the sentence. Note that the nouns precede their adjectives.

The weak endings become active in proximity to the noun when it follows either a demonstrative pronoun or the definite article. Take a look at the following sentence:

> Sigldi hann fyrst í Austrveginn, ok varð honum bæði gott til fjár ok mannorðs, en aldri lá hann svá vakandi, at væri eigi honum fyrir augum __sú fagra h&#x2DB;nd__ ok __þat væna gull__, sem hann missti í Aldeigjuborg. (First he sailed to Austrveg, and did well will both wealth and reputations, but he never lay awake, that there would not be before his eyes that lovely hand, and that lovely gold, that he lost in Staraya Ladoga.)
<!--Hálfdanar Saga Eysteinsson, 10-->

There are two nominative clusters used in this sentence, both marked in bold. The noun, _h&#x2DB;nd_ is modified by the demonstrative _sú_, which communicates strong grammatical declination of the feminine noun. The adjective, _fagra_ therefore takes the weak ending. The same thing likewise occurs int he second construction. The noun, _gull_ is a neuter noun that is modified by the demonstrative, _þat_. Because it follows the demonstrative, the adjective _væna_ is suffixed by a weak adjective declension. 

The weak adjective endings are also used when grammatical case is already indicated by the definite article. 

> F&#x2DB;rum til skipa tíðast, þar siglir nú __Ormr inn langi__ austan. (Let us go as soon as possible, the Long Dragon sails there now.)
<!--Fagrskinna, Olaf T. ch. 24-->

Notice how the definite article detaches from the noun. When in this position, particularly with proper nouns, the sequence is often translated with the English article following the noun and preceding the adjective. Note that in each case, the adjective takes a weak ending.

> Hans sonr var __Ormr inn sterki__. (His son was Dragon the strong.)
<!--Egla 23-->
<!--__Inn helgi Jón byskup__ hafði skamma stund at stóli setit at Hólum áðr en hann lét leggja ofan kirkju þá er þar var. Jóns saga helga, 8-->

A common anomalous adjective is _samr_. This verb often functions with it's weak endings even if there is no definite formation or demonstrative present. For example, 

> Hirðmenn hafa nú sama vanða, ok kasta fyrst smám beinum um þvert gólfit til b&#x2DB;ðvars ok Hattar (The hirð men now display the same behavior, and first threw small bones across the floor toward Boðvar and H&#x2DB;ttr.)

Other adjective to remember is, _annarr_, and _allr_. These were always strong no matter their position.

> Þá spurði hann þau tiðendi, at Sveinn konungr var kominn til Sjálandz ok þá var kominn til hans __herr sjá allr__. (Then he learned these tidings, that King Sveinn came to Zealand, and __that entire army__ came to him.)

A partitive adjective construction also exists in a similar sense in English in which one might say, "He drank half of the bottle."

> Ek á nu __hálft eitt dýrit__. (I now have half of an animal.)



### Declension of Present Participles and the Comparatives of Adjectives

#### Singular

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | hvassari     | hvassari     | hvassara
Acc. | hvassara    | hvassari    | hvassara
Dat. | hvassara    | hvassari   | hvassara
Gen. | hvassara     | hvassari  | hvassara

#### Plural

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | hvassari     | hvassari  | hvassari
Acc. | hvassari     | hvassari   | hvassari
Dat. | hvǫssurum    | hvǫssurum   | hvǫssurum
Gen. | hvassari     | hvassari  | hvassari

Other words that decline this way include,

_ellri, stærri, gefandi, deyandi..._.

### Comparison of Adjectives

The comparative and superlative forms of the adjectives are constructed with the suffixes, _-ari_, and _-astr_. Disyllables in _-ligr_ dropped the _-a_ of these endings.

Positive | Comparative | Superlative
---------|-------------|------------
hvass    | hvassari    | hvassaster
heilagr  | helgari     | helgastr
ríkr     | ríkari      | ríkastr
efniligr | efniligri   | efniligstr

The _j_ and the _v_ of adjectives like ríkr and gløggr were usually not retained in the comparative and superlative forms.

Positive | Comparative | Superlative
---------|-------------|------------
fagr     | fegri       | fegrstr
hár      |  hæri       |  hæstr
seinn    | seinni      |  seinstr

This category includes _fár, langr, lágr, skammr, smár, ungr, vænn_.

The following had comparative and superlative from a different root, or had no positive, the root appearing otherwise only in an adverb.

Positive | Comparative | Superlative
---------|-------------|------------
gamall   | ellri       | elztr
góðr     | betri       | beztr, baztr
illr, vándr | verri    | verstr
lítill   | minni       | minstr
mikill   | meiri       | mestr
         | œðri        |  œztr
(aptr)   | eptri       | apztr, aptastr
(fyrir)  | fyrri       | fyrstr
(of)     | øfri, efri  |  øfstr, efstr
(út)     | ýtri        | ýztr
(austr)  | eystri      | austastr

A comparative adjective might be followed by _en_ 'than' with the same case as the comparative, or, if _en_ was not used, by the dative: _launaði hann því fleira?_ 'Did he reward you with more than this?'
