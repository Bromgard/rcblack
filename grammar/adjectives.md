# Adjectives in Old Icelandic

## Proto-Indo-European nominal modifiers

The Proto-Indo-European noun was modified by three different conditional constructions:

1) By means of a construction of a coupling (a pattern that would later become many compound nouns) with another noun.

_Stone Roses_, _Mushroomhead_, _Sex Pistols_

2) By means of the genitive case.

_Jane's Addiction, Mary's Danish, Herman's Hermits_

3) Dedicated noun modifiers. The Proto-Indo-European adjective is a familiar part of speech that specifies a specific quality belonging to the accompanying noun. These adjectives had their own system of grammatical declension which may have been inherited from an older system of nominal genitives (or some other grammatical case). In PIE, the adjectives likewise decline to agree with its accompanying noun.

_Green Day, Twisted Sister, Fleet Foxes._

Just as in contemporary speech, there is overlap between these categories. Nouns may easily function as adjectives and vice versa.

Because of this natural overlap, it is possible that before the reconstructed phase of Indo-European development, adjectives and nouns shared the same declensions. However there is evidence in the reconstructed PIE, that the distinction between natural nouns and adjectives, and their declensions were becoming more distinct from each other. In modern Indo-European languages that retain a system of declension, the behavior of adjectives and nouns are gradually becoming more idiomatic.

### Adjective usage in Old Icelandic

The usage of strong and weak declensions is consistent with their usage in modern German. When standing alone as a modifier to a noun, the adjective always takes the strong ending.

> __Eiríkr alspakr__ hét __lendr maðr__ í Nóregi. ([A] landed man is named Eirík All-wise.)
<!--_Egla_, chapt. 64-->

This sentence contains two simple noun-adjective pairs, __Eiríkr alspakr__, and __lendr maðr__. The word, _lendr_ is an adjective that carries the strong nominative adjective ending in parallel with _maðr_. The other noun-adjective pairing, _Eiríkr alspakr_, that begins the sentence likewise displays two strong nominative endings. Note that the nouns precede their adjectives.

The weak endings become active in proximity to the noun when it follows either a demonstrative pronoun or the definite article. Take a look at the following sentence:

> Sigldi hann fyrst í Austrveginn, ok varð honum bæði gott til fjár ok mannorðs, en aldri lá hann svá vakandi, at væri eigi honum fyrir augum __sú fagra h&#x1EB;nd__ ok __þat væna gull__, sem hann missti í Aldeigjuborg. (First he sailed to Russia, and did well in both wealth and reputation, but always while he lay awake, there would not be before his eyes that beautiful hand and that lovely gold, which he lost in Staraya Ladoga.)
<!--Hálfdanar Saga Eysteinsson, 10-->

There are two nominative clusters used in this sentence, both marked in bold. The noun, _h&#x1EB;nd_ is modified by the demonstrative _sú_, which communicates strong grammatical declination of the feminine noun. The adjective, _fagra_ therefore takes the weak ending. The same thing likewise occurs in the second construction. The noun, _gull_ is a neuter noun that is modified by the demonstrative, _þat_. Because it follows the demonstrative, the adjective _væna_ is suffixed by a weak adjective declension.

The weak adjective endings are also used when grammatical case is already indicated by the definite article. 

> F&#x1EB;rum til skipa tíðast, þar siglir nú __Ormr inn langi__ austan. (Let us go as soon as possible, the Long Dragon sails there now.)
<!--Fagrskinna, Olaf T. ch. 24-->

Notice how the definite article detaches from the noun. When in this position, particularly with proper nouns, the sequence is often translated with the English article following the noun and preceding the adjective. Note that in each case, the adjective takes a weak ending.

> Hans sonr var __Ormr inn sterki__. (His son was Dragon the strong.)
<!--Egla 23-->
<!--__Inn helgi Jón byskup__ hafði skamma stund at stóli setit at Hólum áðr en hann lét leggja ofan kirkju þá er þar var. Jóns saga helga, 8-->

A common anomalous adjective is _samr_. This verb often functions with it's weak endings even if there is no definite formation or demonstrative present. For example, 

> Hirðmenn hafa nú sama vanða, ok kasta fyrst smám beinum um þvert gólfit til b&#x1EB;ðvars ok Hattar (The hirð men now display the same behavior, and first threw small bones across the floor toward Boðvar and H&#x1EB;ttr.)

Other adjective to remember is, _annarr_, and _allr_. These were always strong no matter their position.

> Þá spurði hann þau tiðendi, at Sveinn konungr var kominn til Sjálandz ok þá var kominn til hans __herr sjá allr__. (Then he learned these tidings, that King Sveinn came to Zealand, and __that entire army__ came to him.)

A partitive adjective construction also exists in a similar sense in English in which one might say, "He drank half of the bottle."

> Ek á nu __hálft eitt dýrit__. (I now have half of an animal.)

## Declension of Adjectives in Old Icelandic

Overall, the adjective declensions are very similar to the nouns. Like the nouns they similarly decline by gender and number. Unlike the nouns, each adjective uses both the strong and weak declension depending on the presence of other modifiers in the sentence. The rules for this are discussed below. As always there are a few differences between the adjectival and noun endings. As you read, be sure you make note of them as you find them as you find them.

### Strong Declension

The strong adjectival declension is very similar to the noun declensions in that there is a well-populated category of _-a_ and _-o_ stems (the "default" declensions below) and _-ja_ and _-wa_ stems. The word, [langr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/langr) is a good example of the "basic" strong declension.

Like the nouns, individual adjectives may display contraction with their grammar endings, and some display unpredictable irregularities.

#### Singular

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | langr     | lǫng     | langt
Acc. | langan    | langa    | langt
Dat. | lǫngum    | langri   | lǫngu
Gen. | langs     | langrar  | langs

#### Plural

Gen. | langra     | langra  | langra

Note the changes exhibited by the _-ll_ in _gamal_. The _-ll_ of this word eclipses and contracts the initial part of the grammar suffix. Some adjectives, like [fagr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fagr), have a root that already terminates in _-r_, which is also expressed in its declension.

#### Singular

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | gamall     | gǫmul     | gamalt
Acc. | gamlan    | gamla    | gamalt
Dat. | gǫmlum    | gamalli   | gǫmlu
Gen. | gamals     | gamallar  | gamals

#### Plural

Acc. | gamla     | gamlar   | gǫmul
Dat. | gǫmlum    | gǫmlum   | gǫmlum
Gen. | gamalla     | gamalla  | gamalla

Some adjectives like [fagr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/langr) have a terminal _-r_ that is part of the root of the word and is not a grammatical ending. There are a few of these, so be aware of these.

#### Singular

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | fagr     | fǫgr     | fagrt
Acc. | fagran    | fagra    | fagrt
Dat. | fǫgrum    | fagri   | fǫgru
Gen. | fagrs     | fagrar  | fagrs

#### Plural

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | fagrir     | fagrar  | fǫgr
Acc. | fagra     | fagrar   | fǫgr
Dat. | fǫgrum    | fǫgrum   | fǫgrum
Gen. | fagra    | fagra  | fagra

Among those declensions that display patterns of contraction are the words that have a root that ends with a vowel, such as [blár](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bl%C3%A1r#Old_Norse). 

#### Singular

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | blár     | blá     | blátt
Acc. | bláan    | bláa    | blátt
Dat. | bláum    | blárri   | bláu
Gen. | blás     | blárrar  | blás

#### Plural

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter

Acc. | bláa     | bláar   | blá
Dat. | bláum    | bláum   | bláum
Gen. | blárra   | blárra  | blárra

Another declension pattern to make note of, just because of it's peculiarities, is _annarr_. Also note that this word only declines strongly.

#### Singular

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | annarr     | ǫnnur     | annat
Acc. | annan     | aðra    | annat
Dat. | ǫðrum    | annari   | ǫðrum
Gen. | annars     | annarrar  | annars

#### Plural

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | aðrir     | aðrar  | ǫnnur
Acc. | aðra     | aðrar   | ǫnnur
Dat. | ǫðrum    | ǫðrum  | ǫðrum
Gen. | annarra     | annarra  | annarra

### The _-ja_ adjectives

A good example of a _-ja_ adjective is [miðr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mi%C3%B0r). The adjective, [nýr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/n%C3%BDr#Old_Norse) is another such word.  

#### Singular

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | miðr     | mið    | mitt
Acc. | miðjan    | miðja    | mitt
Dat. | miðjum    | miðri   | miðju
Gen. | miðs     | miðrar  | miðs

#### Plural

Acc. | miðja     | miðjar   | mið
Dat. | miðjum    | miðjum   | miðjum
Gen. | miðra   | miðra  | miðra

### The _-wa_ adjectives

The word, [gløggr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gl%C3%B8ggr) is a word that's not used enough that exhibits the _-wa_ pattern. Another adjective, [hár](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/h%C3%A1r#Old_Norse) has a very interesting declension pattern that preserves the ancient particle. 

#### Singular

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. |  gløggr  | gløgg  | gløgt
Acc. | gløggvan    | gløggva  | gløgt
Dat. | gløggum    | gløggri  | gløggu
Gen. | gløggs     | gløggrar  | gløggs

#### Plural

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | gløggvir   | gløggvar | gløgg
Acc. | gløggva   | gløggvar   | gløgg
Dat. | gløggum    | gløggum   | gløggum
Gen. | gløggra   | gløggra  | gløggra

### The Weak Declension

-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | langi     | langa     | langa
Acc. | langa    | lǫngu    | langa
