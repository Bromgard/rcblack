# Strong adjectives in Old Icelandic

## Proto-Indo-European nominal modifiers

The Proto-Indo-European noun was modified by three different conditional constructions:

1) By means of a construction of a coupling (a pattern that would later become many compound nouns) with another noun.

> _Stone Roses_, _Mushroomhead_, _Sex Pistols_

2) By means of the genitive case.

> _Jane's Addiction, Mary's Danish, Herman's Hermits_

3) Dedicated noun modifiers. The Proto-Indo-European adjective is a familiar part of speech that specifies a specific quality belonging to the accompanying noun. These adjectives had their own system of grammatical declension which may have been inherited from an older system of nominal genitives (or some other grammatical case). In PIE, the adjectives likewise decline to agree with its accompanying noun.

> _Green Day, Twisted Sister, Fleet Foxes._

Just as in contemporary speech, there is overlap between these categories. Nouns may easily function as adjectives and vice versa.

Because of this natural overlap, it is possible that before the reconstructed phase of Indo-European development, adjectives and nouns shared the same declensions. However there is evidence in the reconstructed PIE, that the distinction between natural nouns and adjectives, and their declensions were becoming more distinct from each other. In modern Indo-European languages that retain a system of declension, the individual behaviors of adjectives and nouns are gradually becoming more idiomatic.

### The strong declensions

Because early adjectives and nouns developed so closely, the strong adjectival declensions are very similar to the noun declensions in that there is a well-populated category of _-a_ and _-o_ stems (the "default" declensions below) and _-ja_ and _-wa_ stems. The word, [langr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/langr) is a good example of the "basic" strong declension.

Like the nouns, individual adjectives may display contraction with their grammar endings, and some display unpredictable irregularities.

#### Singular

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | langr     | lǫng     | langt
Acc. | langan    | langa    | langt
Dat. | lǫngum    | langri   | lǫngu
Gen. | langs     | langrar  | langs

#### Plural

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | langir     | langar  | lǫng
Acc. | langa     | langar   | lǫng
Dat. | lǫngum    | lǫngum   | lǫngum
Gen. | langra     | langra  | langra

Note the changes exhibited by the _-ll_ in _gamal_. The _-ll_ of this word eclipses and contracts the initial part of the grammar suffix.

#### Singular

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | gamall     | gǫmul     | gamalt
Acc. | gamlan    | gamla    | gamalt
Dat. | gǫmlum    | gamalli   | gǫmlu
Gen. | gamals     | gamallar  | gamals

#### Plural

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | gamlir     | gamlar  | gǫmul
Acc. | gamla     | gamlar   | gǫmul
Dat. | gǫmlum    | gǫmlum   | gǫmlum
Gen. | gamalla     | gamalla  | gamalla

Some adjectives like [fagr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/langr) have a terminal _-r_ that is part of the root of the word and is not a grammatical ending.

#### Singular

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | fagr     | fǫgr     | fagrt
Acc. | fagran    | fagra    | fagrt
Dat. | fǫgrum    | fagri   | fǫgru
Gen. | fagrs     | fagrar  | fagrs

#### Plural

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | fagrir     | fagrar  | fǫgr
Acc. | fagra     | fagrar   | fǫgr
Dat. | fǫgrum    | fǫgrum   | fǫgrum
Gen. | fagra    | fagra  | fagra

Among those declensions that display patterns of contraction are the words that have a root that ends with a vowel, such as [blár](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bl%C3%A1r#Old_Norse). 

#### Singular

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | blár     | blá     | blátt
Acc. | bláan    | bláa    | blátt
Dat. | bláum    | blárri   | bláu
Gen. | blás     | blárrar  | blás

#### Plural

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | bláir     | bláar  | blá
Acc. | bláa     | bláar   | blá
Dat. | bláum    | bláum   | bláum
Gen. | blárra   | blárra  | blárra

Another declension pattern to make note of, just because of it's peculiarities, is _annarr_. Also note that this word only declines strongly.

#### Singular

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | annarr     | ǫnnur     | annat
Acc. | annan     | aðra    | annat
Dat. | ǫðrum    | annari   | ǫðrum
Gen. | annars     | annarrar  | annars

#### Plural

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | aðrir     | aðrar  | ǫnnur
Acc. | aðra     | aðrar   | ǫnnur
Dat. | ǫðrum    | ǫðrum  | ǫðrum
Gen. | annarra     | annarra  | annarra

### The _-ja_ adjectives

A good example of a _-ja_ adjective is [miðr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mi%C3%B0r). The adjective, [nýr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/n%C3%BDr#Old_Norse) is another such word.  

#### Singular

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | miðr     | mið    | mitt
Acc. | miðjan    | miðja    | mitt
Dat. | miðjum    | miðri   | miðju
Gen. | miðs     | miðrar  | miðs

Gen. | miðra   | miðra  | miðra

### The _-wa_ adjectives

The word, [gløggr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gl%C3%B8ggr) is a word that's not used enough that exhibits the _-wa_ pattern. Another adjective, [hár](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/h%C3%A1r#Old_Norse) has a very interesting declension pattern that preserves the ancient particle. 

#### Singular

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------

Acc. | gløggvan    | gløggva  | gløgt
