# Pronunciation

## Introduction

It is important to consider that the system of pronunciation of an historic language is largely an artificial construction that is far removed from the living culture that originally used the language. 
If the historical language is no longer spoken, a living community often reconstructs the grammar, lexicography, and phonetics for specific uses that are often far removed from the original context. The preconceptions and ideologies of community necessarily affects the reconstruction, which results in an idealized synthetic system distinct from the natural, spoken language. But despite the efforts of such standardization, language always has a natural tendency toward diversity.

For example, the historical span of the Latin language as a so-called "living language" spans nearly a thousand years. In the first century CE, the natural and inevitable diversity of the Latin language was largely erased by a centralized standard known as "Classical Latin." Of course, the motivation for this standardization was ideological, but nevertheless Latin naturally changed, evolved, and then differentiated into the Romance Languages in the medieval period. Latin was maintained by the Catholic Church and was used as a tool to consolidate it's own power and influence, over regions that spoke diverse languages. Even formalized institutional languages naturally diversify. Today you can find distinct Latin phonetic systems that are specific to English speakers, Finnish, and so on. Some of these "national dialects" preserve sound changes from the dominant language. The Humanist Latin of the Renaissance used by Galileo and Newton was a standardization that ideologically distanced itself from the medievalisms of Church Latin and a performative attempt to resurrect a classical ideal. Unfortunately this classical ideal   


## The alphabet

The alphabet of Old Icelandic was largely imported from vernacular systems that were in use in Scandinavia, Germany, the low countries, and Britain and Ireland. In fact, the earliest extant manuscripts in Iceland display a distinct affinity with Insular scriptoral tradition. Ecclesiastical control of the Icelandic church was handed over to the Nidaros see in 1153, introducing both Scandinavian and German scriptoral traditions into Iceland. There is much orthographic variety in medieval Icelandic manuscript, particularly in the early period, but modern transcriptions, like the ones you well translate in this class are generally normalized and standardized at least to some extent. Unless indicated, this is the alphabet you will see in most editions:

A, a, B, b, D, d, Ð, ð, E, e, F, f, G, g, H, h, I, i, J, j, K, k, L, l, M, n, O, o, P, p, R, r, S, s, T, t, U, u, V, v, X, x, Y, y, Z, z, Þ, þ, Æ, æ, Œ, œ, Ǫ, ǫ

* The usage of eth (Ð and ð) and thorn (Þ and þ) is unrelated to pre-scriptoral runic usages and were most likely imported with insular scripts. Both are equivalent to the values represented in modern English, "th."
* The character "j" is a modern typographic character and only appears in the manuscripts as a stylized variant of "i," but most editions follow modern orthographic conventions. For example "Bjorn" most often appears as "biorn" in the sources.
* "Q" is not used, and rarely appears in the vernacular language in the manuscripts.
* The non-Latin vowels, "æ," "œ," and "ǫ," are all derived from a Continental pattern of representing vowels whose sound qualities stood between sounds that were already represented by existing Latin vowels. The character, "æ," the "a-ligature," or "aesc" is another letter that likely first came into Iceland by Insular script traditions and was taken to be a sound that lied somewhere between "a," and, "e." The "o-e ligature" stands likewise somewhere between the qualities of those two vowels. The origins of the, "o oganek," evolved in the continent as a variant of the o-e ligature as an "o," with a smaller e connected on the bottom. The smaller e was quickly simplified to the hook familiar to us today. The modern umlaut has a similar development with an e attached to the top of the vowel.
* There is some variation to how modern normalizations handle the non-Latin vowels. Cleasby/Vigfusson normalizes œ into æ, so only one ligature is used. Cleasby/Vigfusson also normalizes ǫ to ö. You may find the occasional edition using this convention.

## Saga pronunciation

The historical span of Old Icelandic is often taken to last from the beginnings of the extant vernacular literature in the early twelfth century to about 1500 at the very latest. This is the same span of time that divides us from Shakespeare, so it's not surprising to learn that Old Icelandic underwent many changes during that time. Most of the saga corpus was committed to parchment from the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries CE, but modern grammarians tend to normalize the text to a phonological system that may have been spoken in the first decades of the thirteenth century. 

One of the reasons for this is that the pronunciation of Icelandic was documented in one of the earliest examples of Scandinavian vernacular language, _Fyrsta málfræðiritgerðin_, or, _The First Grammatical Treatise_, written by who is known today as the First Grammarian. The work itself is a systemic study of Old Icelandic phonetic system and grammar that maybe have been written sometime before 1200. This phonetic system would have likely have sounded odd to the Icelanders who composed the sagas we will read in class, given that they were written decades to over a century later. You can often spot these changes in the orthography and usage in the texts, and I will point out many of these changes as we read.  

### Vowels

The vowel system is not unlike that of other Indo-European languages in that each vowel has two qualities, long and short. The long vowels are indicated with an acute mark (á). The short vowels generally similar in quality to the English short vowel, and the long vowels approximate a similar quality but with a more sustained duration. The specific positions of each vowel is described below. 

* The long vowels are á, é, í, ó, ú, æ, œ.
* The short vowels are a, e, i, o, u, ???
