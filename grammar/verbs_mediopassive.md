# The Old Icelandic Mediopassive voice

The Old Icelandic Mediopassive voice is characterized here by the verbs that contain a conjugated suffix that is formed from reflexive pronouns. So, the mediopassive form of the verb, _gefa_, in the first person singular is _gefumk_, from _gefa_ + _-mik_. Likewise, the third person singular of the verb is, _gefsk_, from _gefr_ + _-sik_. Note that the terminal _-r_ is syncopated here in the final formation. Historically this is a particularly Norse linguistic trait that developed into specific passive and middle structures that are still in use today. The complete mediopassive conjugation of the verb, _gefa_ is as follows. Note that many editions of saga period texts display exhibit later formations that appear in many manuscripts in which the endings are normalized to _-s_ or _-z_.

## The reflexive and reciprocal usages

The reflexive voice in Germanic languages appear when the subject of the verb is the same as the active object, who is also the causal agent. The simplest reflexive statement is often indicated by the English, _myself_, _yourself_ _herself_, or _themselves_.

> The barber shaves both the village and himself.

The word, _himself_, is the reflexive pronoun that signals that the subject of the sentence is also the object, and causal agent of the shaving.

> Jake shaves every morning. 

Common context, and that the verb, _shaves_ does not need to be transitive, communicates all we need to know about Jakes activities every morning. But looks at the following cognate sentence in Swedish. 

> Jake rakar sig varje morgon.

In this sentence, the reflexive pronoun is a grammatical requirement that modifies the verb. Now look at the verb in this Old Icelandic sentence. 

> Eyvindr [varðisk](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/verja#Verb_4) vel ok drengiliga. (Eyvindr defended himself well and manfully.)

In this sentence, _varðisk_ is equivalent to, _varði sik_, in a very simple reflexive construction.

### Reciprocal verbs

You will also see the _-sk_ verbs used reciprocally. Reciprocal sentences occur in English when the pronoun construction, _each other_ is used.

> In these dark times we must always support _each other_. 

So, in this sentence, the subject and causal agent of the action is exchanged equally between two or more entities. The verb carries passiveness because the subject and the objects are always the same. In the following Old Icelandic sentence, the _-sk_ ending carries an equivalent grammatical function as _each other_.

> Eptir þetta tekr B&#x1eb;ðvarr til hans ok __áttusk__ þeir við lengi.

## Passive voice

The _-sk_ words occasionally communicate the passive voice. Remember that you will also encounter natural passive constructions.

> Sæmundr hafði heitið hónum at __sættask__ við Ögmund. (Sæmund had promised him to be reconciled with Ögmund.)

## Intransitive verbs

This grammatical usage is similar in appearance to Old Icelandic reflexive verbs, but the verb is expressed intransitively, that is in a form in which the verb does not take an object. Take a look at the following sentence:

> Þá __gj&x#1EB;rðisk__ vágskorit landit ok heldu þeir skipunum at vágunum. (And then inlet-cut land appeared, and they held the course of their ships to to the inlets.) 

Another interesting construction also occurs when an auxiliary/infinitive phrase is expressed in a way that the subject of the infinitive phrase is the same as the subject of the greater sentence.

> Flosi kvazk heyra mega. (Flosi said that he could hear.) 

Aslso, 

> Skírnir lézk ganga mundu. (Skírnir said that he could go.)
