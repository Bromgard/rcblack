# The Old Icelandic Mediopassive voice

The Old Icelandic Mediopassive voice is characterized here the verbs that contain a conjugated suffix that is formed from the reflexive pronouns. So, the mediopassive form of the verb, _gefa_, in the first person singular is _gefumk_, from _gefa_ + _-mik_. Likewise, the third person singular of the verb is, _gefsk_, from _gefr_ + _-sik_. Note that the terminal _-r_ is syncopated in the final formation. Historically this is a particularly Norse linguistic trait that developed into specific passive and middle structures that are still in use today in Icelandic. The complete conjugation of the verb, _gefa_ is as follows. Note that many editions of saga period texts display exhibit later formations that appear in many manuscripts in which the endings are normalized to _-s_ or _-z_.

## The reflexive voice

The reflexive voice in Germanic languages appear when the subject of the verb is the same as the active object, who is also the causal agent. The simplest reflexive statement is often indicated by the English, _myself_, _yourself_ _herself_, or _themselves_.

> The barber shaves both the village and himself.

The word, _himself_, is the reflexive pronoun that signals to the reader that the subject of the sentence is also the object, and causal agent of the shaving.

> Jake shaves every morning. 

Common context, and that the verb, _shaves_ does not need to be transitive, communicates all we need to know about Jakes activities every morning. But looks at the following cognate sentence in Swedish. 

> Jake rakar sig varje morgon.

In this case, the reflexive pronoun is a grammatical requirement that reflexively modifies the verb. Now look at the verb in this Old Icelandic sentence. 

> Eyvindr [varðisk](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/verja#Verb_4) vel ok drengiliga. (Eyvindr defended himself well and manfully.)

In this case, _varðisk_ is equivalent to, _varði sik_, in a very simple reflexive construction.

## Passive voice

This verbal construction with the _-sk_ sometimes communicated the passive voice.
