# Nominal Gender and declension

## Strong Nouns

Old Icelandic noun declensions are generically classed into three genders, masculine, feminine, and neuter. Each gender is likewise organized into strong strong and weak declensions which altogether make six total declension patterns.

The categories do share some affinities with social gender. This is why early grammarians in the antique tradition coined the use of gendered categories when they codified the patterns in Latin and Greek.

Gender | Ice. | Eng.
-------|------|------
Fem.   | kona | woman
Masc.  | karl | man
Neut.  | barn | child

However it is very important to remember that grammatical gender has very little to do with social gender. For our purposes, grammatical gender is best understood as systemic patterns that can be used organize the nominal declensions of Old Icelandic nouns and adjectives. 

The declension pattern of _konungr_ will look much like the declension patterns of many other masculine nouns. Remember _konungr_?

| Case &nbsp; | Sing. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Sing. Def. &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural Def.|
|:-----|:---------|:-----------|:---------|:------------|
| Nom. | konungr  | konungrinn | konungar | konungarnir |
| Acc. | konung   | konunginn  | konunga  | konungana   |
| Dat. | konungi  | konunginum | konungum | konungunum  |
| Gen. | konungs  | konungsins | konunga  | konunganna  |

Let's take a look at the declension of the stong, neuter noun, _dýr_ (animal). 

| Case &nbsp; | Sing. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Sing. Def. &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural Def.|
|:-----|:-----|:--------|:------|:--------|
| Nom. | dýr  | dýrit   | dýr   | dýrin   |
| Acc. | dýr  | dýrit   | dýr   | dýrin   |
| Dat. | dýri | dýrinu  | dýrum | dýrunum |
| Gen. | dýrs | dýrsins | dýra  | dýrana  |

Compare the differences. In the indefinite formations, the nominative and accusative cases in both singular and plural lose their distinctions. The terminal 'm' is lost in the article formation in dative singular, but the rest of the formations retain the same pattern. The neuter class is expressed in the distinct formations in the suffixed definite article, _-it, -inu_.

Now let's take a look and the declension of the strong, feminine noun, _ferð_ (journey).

| Case &nbsp; | Sing. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Sing. Def. &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural Def.|
|:-----|:---------|:------------|:-------|:---------|
| Nom. | ferð     | ferðin      | ferðir | ferðinar |
| Acc. | ferð     | ferðina     | ferðir | ferðinar |
| Dat. | ferð     | ferðinni    | ferðum | ferðunum |
| Gen. | ferðar   | ferðarinnar | ferða  | ferðanna |

As you can see, the only distinct formation in singular indefinite is the genitive case (much like in English). The plural indefinite formations are more like strong masculine nouns in that they distinguish themselves from the singular in the nominative and accusatives cases with the _-ir_ suffix.

## Weak Declensions

The reason we call the declension of the above nouns strong is because they communicate strong information about their grammatical use. The weak nouns are called so because they communicate weak grammatical information in their formations. Take a look at the following weak nouns:

### Weak Masculine, _tími_ (time)

| Case &nbsp; | Sing. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Sing. Def. &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural Def.|
|:-----|:---------|:-----------|:---------|:------------|
| Nom. | tími | tíminn  | tímar | tímarnir |
| Acc. | tíma | tímann  | tíma  | tímana   |
| Dat. | tíma | tímanum | tímum | tímunum  |
| Gen. | tíma | tímans  | tíma  | tímanna  |

### Weak Neuter, _auga_ (eye)

| Case &nbsp; | Sing. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Sing. Def. &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural Def.|
|:-----|:-----|:-------|:------|:---------|
| Nom. | auga | augat  | augu  | augun    |
| Acc. | auga | augat  | augu  | augun    |
| Dat. | auga | auganu | augum | augunum  |
| Gen. | auga | augans | augna | augnanna |


### Weak Feminine, _tunga_ (tongue, language)

| Case &nbsp; | Sing. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Sing. Def. &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural Def.|
|:-----|:---------|:-----------|:---------|:------------|
| Nom. | tunga  | tungan    | tungur  | tungurnar |
| Acc. | tungu  | tunguna   | tungur  | tungurnar |
| Dat. | tungu  | tungunni  | tungum  | tungunum  |
| Gen. | tungu  | tungunnar | tungna  | tunganna  |

As you can see these declinations are generally weaker than the strong nouns, particularly in the indefinite singular formations. When used the suffixed definite article relays information about the noun's gender and grammatical case. In all cases, if the noun's formation doesn't communicate information, look to the other words in the sentence for help, refer to reading context. 

Note the regularity of the patterns in dative and genitive plural. The strong _-m_ in the dative plural formations will always save you some time!

Altogether we can assemble the following general patterns for indefinite nouns from these examples.

### Strong Masculine

| Case | Sing | Plural |
|:-----|:----:|:-------|
| Nom. |  -r  |  -ar or ir  |
| Acc. |  --  |  -a, -i, or -u |
| Dat. | -i or -- | -um | 
| Gen. | -s or -ar| -a  |

### Weak Masculine

| Case | Sing | Plural |
|:-----|:----:|:-------|
| Nom. |  -i  |  -ar   |
| Acc. |  -a  |  -a    |
| Dat. |  -a  |  -um   | 
| Gen. |  -a  |  -a    |

### Strong Neuter

| Case | Sing | Plural |
|:-----|:----:|:-------|
| Nom. |  --  |  --    |
| Acc. |  --  |  --    |
| Dat. | -i   | -um    | 
| Gen. | -s   |  -a    |

### Weak Neuter

| Case | Sing | Plural |
|:-----|:----:|:-------|
| Nom. |  -a  |  -u    |
| Acc. |  -a  |  -u    |
| Dat. |  -a  |  -um   | 
| Gen. |  -a  |  -na   |

### Strong Feminine

| Case | Sing | Plural |
|:-----|:----:|:-------|
| Nom. |  --  |  -ar or ir  |
| Acc. |  --  |  -ar or ir |
| Dat. |  --  |  -um   | 
| Gen. |  -ar | -a     |

### Weak Feminine

| Case | Sing | Plural |
|:-----|:----:|:-------|
| Nom. |  -a  |  -ur   |
| Acc. |  -u  |  -ur   |
| Dat. |  -u  |  -um   | 
| Gen. |  -u  |  -na   |





The noun paradigms offered in the previous lesson and outlined in Aleric's sheet are good rules-of-thumb you can use to reference while you begin reading your first texts. Zoega's concise dictionary also contains a very handy reference grammar as well. However, be aware that there are many exceptions to these rules. Some resources break down the nouns into even more categories. Others organize the noun paradigms based on reconstructed relationships uncovered by historical comparative linguists. I believe the simplest course of action is simply learn attributes of each noun as you build your vocabulary. When you memorize a noun, be mindful of the noun's gender and it's pattern of declension. So, when you acquaint yourself with a new noun, say, _konungr_, it would be most useful to memorize the definite article alongside the lexical form to internalize the noun's gender.

It is also highly recommended that the student consult the academic dictionaries often, particularly Cleasby-Vifusson's disctionary.
