# The seven kinds of pronouns in Old Icelandic

Icelandic displays its Germanic and Indo-European heritage in its complex system of pronouns. Maybe of these will be familiar to you through English or other of your languages. Like always, the difficulties come with their declensions. 

## Personal pronouns

## Interrogative pronouns

These are the "what" and "who" pronouns that often occur in interrogative statements and clauses. You will encounter these regularly, so it's best to memorize them in a batch. You can recognize these pronouns in Icelandic by the _hv-_ that always precedes the words. This sound cluster has a very interesting legacy in the history of many Indo-European languages, and is of course common to the _hv-_ in the orthography of the Danish and Norwegian interrogatives. It's also related to Latin _quo_ and _quid_. The continental Germanic aspiration is disappearing (the h sound, not their hopes and dreams), and Swedish and German orthography only a v and a w respectively. Medieval Icelandic pronunciation is actually much closer to early English in that it was originally pronounced as an aspirated "wh" sound. During the time of saga production, the h began to harden and the back of the throat and in modern Icelandic has settled into an unvoiced stop. So, _hvat_ is pronounced like, "kvat."
