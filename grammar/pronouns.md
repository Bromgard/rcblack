# The seven kinds of pronouns in Old Icelandic

The pronomial system of Old Icelandic has many of the familiar forms you might already be familiar with in the Germanic language you already know. Unless you're a German or modern Icelandic speaker, the system of declension is the greatest hurdle. Nevertheless, these words are very common and understanding how they function in the sentences you read is very important. Memorize the personal pronouns, and refer often to the paradigm charts as you read. Always make sure you keep track of the grammatical case. 

## Personal pronouns

### First and second person personal pronouns

Case | 1st. | 2nd.
-----|-----|---
Nom. | ek | þú
Acc. | mik | þik
Dat. | mér | þér
Gen. | mín | þín

#### Dual

Case | 1st. | 2nd.
-----|-----|---
Nom. | vit | it, þit
Acc. | okkr | ykkr
Dat. | okkr | ykkr
Gen. | okkar | ykkar

#### Plural

Case | 1st. | 2nd.
-----|-----|---
Nom. | vér | ér, þér
Acc. | oss | yðr
Dat. | oss | yðr
Gen. | vár | yðar

### Third person personal pronouns

#### Singular

Case | Masc. | Fem. | Neut
-----|-------|------|---
Nom. | hann  | hon | þat
Acc. | hann  | hana | þat
Dat. | honum  | henni | því, þí
Gen. | hans  | hennar | þess

#### Plural

Case | Masc. | Fem. | Neut
-----|------|-------|---
Nom. | þeir  | þær | þau
Acc. | þá   | þær | þau
Dat. | þeim  | þeim | þeim
Gen. | þeir(r)a  | þeir(r)a | þeir(r)a

### Notes

* Sometimes a personal pronoun will be paired with the noun it refers to. Take a look at this example from our first saga:

> Auðunn starfaði fyrir honum Þóri. 

The words, _honum_ and _þóri_ refer to the same person. This either functions to clarify the relationship between the pronoun and the proper noun it refers to, or it functions to emphasize and distinguish the noun.

* Sometimes a plural pronoun is paired with a singular proper noun, like this:

>Þeir Gísli snúa til móts við þá og drepa þá alla. "Gisli _and everyone with him_ turned toward them and killed everyone."

The nominative plural pronoun, _þeir_, (they), isn't named explicitly in the sentence, but Gisli, the leader of his band of men, is. I like to translate this as, "Gisli and his party..."

## Reflexive pronouns

A reflexive pronoun is a pronoun the refers back to the noun that is in the nominative case. That is, the pronoun is both the agent and the subject of the verb's action. Take a look at the following sentence:

> Raymond dried himself off after falling into the vat.

The reflexive pronoun in this sentence is, _myself_, which refers back to the subject of the sentence, _Raymond_. Raymond is simultaneously the agent of the verb's action and the object onto which the agency of the verb is being applied. Raymond is simultaneously drying and being dried. 

### First and second person reflexive pronouns

Except for the nominative case, all the first and second person personal pronouns listed above can function as reflexive pronouns. (If you think about it, it's impossible for a reflexive pronoun to be in the nominative case, because by definition it needs to reflex the action of the verb to the nominative.) 

### Third person reflexive pronouns

The Third person reflexives have their own distinct forms as seen below. All of these work for any gender in both singular and plural cases.

Case | 3rd.
-----|----
Acc. | sik
Dat. | sér
Gen. | sín

### The reflexive possessive pronoun

This pronoun, _sinn_ can be translated as, "her own," "his own," or, "its own," regardless of the gender of the nominative subject. Some resources list this with the possessive pronouns. It has an adjectival declension that looks similar to, _minn_. Compare the declensions.

#### Singular

Case | Masc. | Fem. | Neut
-----|-------|----------|--------
Nom. | sinn  | sín | sitt
Acc. | sinn   | sína | sitt
Dat. | sínum  | sinni | sínu
Gen. | síns  | sinnar | síns

#### Plural

Case | Masc. | Fem. | Neut
-----|-------|----------|--------
Nom. | sínir  | sínar | sín
Acc. | sína  | sínar | sín
Dat. | sínum  | sínum | sínum
Gen. | sinna  | sinna | sinna

## Interrogative pronouns and the _hv-_ words

These are the "what" and "who" pronouns that often occur in interrogative statements and clauses. You will encounter these regularly, so it's best to memorize them in a batch. You can recognize these pronouns in Icelandic by the _hv-_ in the beginning of these words. This sound cluster has a very interesting legacy in the history of many Indo-European languages, and is cognate to the _hv-_ in the orthography of the Danish and Norwegian interrogatives. It's also related to Latin _quo_ and _quid_. The continental Germanic aspiration is disappearing (the h sound, not their hopes and dreams), and Swedish and German orthography only a v and a w respectively. Medieval Icelandic pronunciation is actually much closer to early English in that it was originally pronounced as an aspirated "wh" sound. During the time of saga production, the h began to harden and the back of the throat and in modern Icelandic has settled into an unvoiced stop. So today, _hvat_ is pronounced like, "kvat."

### The personal interrogative, who?

This word represents, English, "who" when referring to a person, and "what," when referring to an object. Note that masculine and feminine is not distinguished.

Case | Masc./Fem. | Neut.
-----|-----------|--------
Nom. | hverr     | hvat
Acc. | hvern     | hvat
Dat. | hveim     | hví
Gen. | hvess     | hvess

### _Hvárr_, which of two

#### Singular

Case | Masc. | Fem. | Neut
--------|---------|----------|--------
Nom. | hvárr  | hvár | hvárt
Acc. | hvárn   | hvára | hvárt
Dat. | hvárum  | hvárri | hváru
Gen. | hvárs  | hvárrar | hvárs

#### Plural

Case | Masc. | Fem. | Neut
---------|--------|----------|--------
Nom. | hvárir  | hvárar |Case | 1st. | 2nd.
-----|-----|---
Nom. | vér | ér, þér
Acc. | oss | yðr
Dat. | oss | yðr
Gen. | vár | yðar hvár
Acc. | hvára   | hvárar | hvár
Dat. | hvárum  | hvárum | hvárum
Gen. | hvárra  | hvárra | hvárra

### _Hverr_, "which of many"

Another form of of this word has another function, meaning, "which." The word also has another meaning, "each of two."

#### Singular

Case | Masc. | Fem. | Neut
-----|-------|----------|--------
Nom. | hverr  | hver | hvert
Acc. | hvern   | hverja | hvert
Dat. | hverjum  | hverri | herjru
Gen. | hvers  | hverrar | hversi

#### Plural

Case | Masc. | Fem. | Neut
-----|---------|--------|---
Nom. | hverir  | hverjar | hver
Acc. | hverja   | hverjar | hver
Dat. | hverjum  | hverjum | hverjum
Gen. | hverra  | hverra | hverra

### Notes

* The word, _hví_ is adjectival, and is used to mean, "why."
* _Hvat_ (what). When a genitive follows, this usually means, "what manner of...," or, "kind of..." Note that the heritage of the English idiom maintains a genitive sense with "of." For example, take a look at this sentence:

> Kenndi menn eigi hvat hvala þat var. "The people did not know what kind of whale that was."

## Possessive pronouns

* The possessive in the first and second persons come from the genitive forms of the personal pronouns above. These forms decline adjectivally.
* There is no adjectival declining forms for the third person, but the genitive forms, _hans_, _þess_, _hennar_, and _þeira_ were used instead.

#### Singular

Person | Sing. 
----|------|---
1st | minn |  
2nd | þinn |

#### Dual

Person | Sing. 
----|------|---
1st | okkar |  
2nd | ykkar |

#### Plural

Person | Pronoun 
---------|----
1st | várr	
2nd | yð(v)arr

### The possessive pronoun declension

The following declension expresses the pattern for _minn_ and _þinn_. The reflexive possessive pronoun, _sinn_, declines like this as well. See above.

#### Singular

Case | Masc. | Fem. | Neut
-----|-------|----------|--------
Nom. | minn  | mín | mitt
Acc. | minn   | mína | mitt
Dat. | mínum  | minni | mínu
Gen. | míns  | minnar | míns

#### Plural

Case | Masc. | Fem. | Neut
------|------|----------|--------
Nom. | mínir  | mínar | mín
Acc. | mína   | mínar | mín
Dat. | mínum  | mínum | mínum
Gen. | minna  | minna | minna

The declensions for _okkarr_, _ykkarr_, and _yðarr_ take the following pattern. 

#### Singular

Case | Masc. | Fem. | Neut
-----|-------|----------|--------
Nom. | okkarr  | okkur | okkart
Acc. | okkarn  | okkra | okkart
Dat. | okkrum  | okkari | okkru
Gen. | okkars  | okkarrar | okkars

#### Plural

Case | Masc. | Fem. | Neut
-----|-------|----------|--------
Nom. | okkrir  | okkrar | okkur
Acc. | okkra | okkrar | okkur
Dat. | okkrum  | okkrum | okkrum
Gen. | okkarra  | okkarra | okkarra

### Notes

* This class of pronouns function as adjectives, so they take on the strong adjective endings.
* The genitive formations like _hans_, _þess_, _hennar_, and _þeira_ were used as undeclined adjectives. 

## Demonstrative pronouns

The demonstrative pronouns are used to stress, identify, or distinguish a specific thing or person, and sometimes their relative position. Old Icelandic, like English, have two kinds of demonstrative pronoun, the _proximal_ and the _distal_. The proximal demonstrative pronoun is the pronoun that expresses an approximate position near the subject or speaker of the sentence. In English we use _this_ to indicate proximity. The distal demonstrative pronoun in English is _that_, which is used to indicate distance from the subject or speaker of the sentence, or to indicate a distinction from other things that were spoken about previously.

The Old Icelandic demonstrative pronouns are _sá_ (this), and _sjá_, (that). Be very careful with the nominative masculine a and feminine formations because it it spelled identically to formations of the verb, [_sjá_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sj%C3%A1#Etymology_2), "to see." 

### Sá, proximal

#### Singular

Case | Masc. | Fem. | Neut
-----|--------|----------|--------
Nom. | sá  | sú | þat
Acc. | þann   | þá | þat
Dat. | þeim  | þeir(r)i | þ(v)í
Gen. | þess  | þeir(r)ar | þess

#### Plural

Case | Masc. | Fem. | Neut
------|----------|----------|--------
Nom. | þeir  | þær | þau
Acc. | þá   | þær | þau
Dat. | þeim | þeim | þeim
Gen. | þeir(r)a  | þeir(r)a | þeir(r)

* Note that the plural formations of _sá_ are identical to the plural formation fo the personal pronoun, _hann_.
 
### Sjá, distal

#### Singular

Case | Masc. | Fem. | Neut
------|----------|----------|--------
Nom. | sjá, þessi  | sjá, þessi | þetta
Acc. | þenna  | þessa | þetta
Dat. | þessum | þessum | þessum
Gen. | þessa  | þessa | þessa

#### Plural

Case | Masc. | Fem. | Neut
---------|-------|----------|--------
Nom. | þessir  | þessar | þessi
Acc. | þessa   | þessar | þessi
Dat. | þessum  | þessum | þessum
Gen. | þessa  | þessa | þessa

## Indefinite pronouns

The indefinite pronouns are used to indicate unknown or imprecise knowledge about a person or thing in a sentence. English indefinite pronouns includesuch words as , _some_, _someone_. _everyone_, _something_, and so on.  

### _sumr_

#### Singular

Case | Masc. | Fem. | Neut
-----|-------|----------|--------
Nom. | sumr  | sum | sumt
Acc. | suman   | suma | sumt
Dat. | sumum  | sumri | sumu
Gen. | sumum | sumrar | sums

#### Plural

Case | Masc. | Fem. | Neut
-----|-------|----------|--------
Nom. | sumir | sumar | sum
Acc. | suma  | sumar | sum
Dat. | sumum  | sumum | sumum
Gen. | sumra  | sumra | sumra

#### Plural

### _einhverr_

This word can be translated directly as, "someone," and even has a similar construction. "Some," is cognate with _sumr_, and "one" is of course cognate with _einn_. The word declines adjectivally like, _hverr_, which can be found in the interrogative pronouns above.

### _nakkvarr, nǫkkurr_

This is a very strange word that you will find come in three forms in the manuscripts. In Zoëga the word is listed as _nǫkkurr_, and Cleasby/Vigfusson lists it as _nekkverr_, which is the latest formation of the word, but you will not see that form in most editions. The word is a contraction and corruption of, _né veit ek hverr_, which means, "I do not know who." The declination is as follows:

#### Singular

Case | Masc. | Fem. | Neut
--------|--------|----------|--------
Nom. | nakkvarr | nǫkkur | nakkvat
Nom. | nǫkkurr  | nǫkkur | nǫkkut
Acc. | nakkvarn | nakkvara| nakkvat
Acc. | nǫkkurn  | nǫkkura | nǫkkut
Dat. | nǫkkurum  | nakkvarri | nǫkkuru
Dat. | nǫkkurum  | nǫkkurri | nǫkkuru
Gen. | nakkvars  | nakkvarrar | nakkvars
Gen. | nǫkkurs   | nǫkkurar | nǫkkurs

#### Plural

Case | Masc. | Fem. | Neut
-----|--------|----------|--------
Nom. | nakkvarir | nakkvarar | nǫkkur
Nom. | nǫkkurir  | nǫkkurar | nǫkkur
Acc. | nakkvara | nakkvarar| nǫkkur
Acc. | nǫkkura  | nǫkkurar | nǫkkur
Dat. | nǫkkurum  | nǫkkurum | nǫkkurum
Dat. | nǫkkurum  | nǫkkurum | nǫkkurum
Gen. | nakkvara  | nakkvara | nakkvara
Gen. | nǫkkura   | nǫkkura | nǫkkura

### Other indefinite pronouns

Other indefinite pronouns include, 

* Another indefinite pronoun is _einn_, which, like English, _one_, operates like the ordinal number. The declension is the same as the number. 
* The word, _annarr_ is much like _einn_ int that is is both an ordinal number and an indefinite pronoun. You will find it sometimes means, "the second," or, "another," "other," or the "next one." The declination is like _nakkvarr_ above. For more on these two words refer to the chapter, "Numeration."

## Relative pronouns

The relative pronouns are the elements that signal the beginning of relative clauses, _which like much like this._ In Old Icelandic, the generic relative pronouns are either _er_, or _sem_. You will also find this pronoun paired with a declension of the demonstrative pronoun, _sá_. So, it is not unusual to see the construction, _sá er_, ("that which," or, "he who) begin a sentence.
