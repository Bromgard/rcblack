# The strong verbs, conjugations 1 and 2

## How strong conjugations work

The Germanic languages share a common pattern of two kinds of verbs. One in which conjugation is conditioned by the simple addition of of a past tense suffix, and another in which the internal vowel of the verb changes along with the conjugation. A common English word that displays this kind of mutation in English is the verb, _to sing_, in which the principal parts are the familiar, _ride_, _rode_, _have ridden_. The principal parts are the conjugation positions in which the verb displays it's strong changes, in this case, the present tense, the past tense, and the past participle. We can see how these changes operate in English grammar in the chart below:

#### Indicative

Person | Present | Past
---|---|---
I | ride | rode
you | ride | rode
she | rides | rode
we | ride | rode
you | ride | rode
they | ride | rode

#### Subjunctive

Person | Present | Past
---|---|---
I | could ride | could have ridden
you | could ride | could have ridden
she | could ride | could have ridden
we | could ride | could have ridden
you pl. | could ride | could have ridden
they | could ride | could have ridden

As we can see, the English changes are overall weak. The only change in person in indicative voice is the _-s_ ending suffix that indicates the third person. All persons share the same form in the past tense. The subjunctive voice voice in English is grammatically deficient in that the grammar word changes have dropped out altogether. The subjunctive function has been transferred to the use of certain auxiliary verbs just as _could_ and _would_. 

Overall there are seven conjugations of Old Icelandic strong verbs and we will survey them over the course of the quarter.

## First strong conjugation

Old Icelandic verbs are stronger than the other Germanic languages and displays more internal change in its grammar. The principal parts for Old Icelandic verbs are as follows:

* The Infinitive--the lexical form expressed also in the third person plural.
* Past, 3rd, Sing
* Past, 3rd, Plural
* Past participle.

These principal parts are enough to compare the conjugations in other Germanic languages.

### First strong conjugation in the Germanic languages

Lang.  | Inf.    | past. sing. | past. pl. | past part.
-------|---------|-------------|-----------|---------
Icel.  | ríða    | reið        |  riðu     | riðinn
Nor.   | ri(de)  | reid        | (reid)    | ride
Dan.   | ri      | riede       | (riede)   | riet
Swe.   | rida    | red         | (red)     | riden
Germ.  | reiten  | ritt        | (reiten)  | geritten
Eng.   | to ride | rode        | (rode)    | ridden
Old En. | ridan   | rad         |  ridon    | (ge)riden

So, the principal parts of Old Icelandic _ríða_ mutate like this in the principal parts: í--ei--i--i(+ -nn). Other verbs of this conjugation will, for the most part follow this same pattern. Like always, there will be irregularities and surprises so consultation with the paradigm chats is always a good idea.

Other important verbs of this conjugation include, [strjúka](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/strj%C3%BAka#Old_Norse), [fljúga](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/flj%C3%BAga#Old_Norse), [ljúga](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lj%C3%BAga#Old_Norse), [bjóða](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bj%C3%B3%C3%B0a#Old_Norse), and [lúka](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/l%C3%BAka#Old_Norse).

Note that not every verb of this conjugation will contain a j, like _lúka_. Take a close look at the conjugation for the word, _ljúga_, which has a few interesting irregularities that record a shift in the past tense from an earlier form of the word to a later one.
