# Participle declensions and comparatives

Participles always display weak substantive declensions, which may tell us something about how the weak declension came into use in Proto-Germanic. The original function of the weak ending was to convert adjectives into a noun. Take a look at the following weak declension of nouns that has it's origin as "nouned verbs."

### The present participle declension

The present participle is a formation in which a verb functions as an adjective. Here is an example of this in English.

> I sit quietly, listening to the __falling__ leaves.
<!--Ryokan, One Robe, One bowl-->

English indicates the present participle with a _-ing_ suffix, and the word functions as an adjectival modifier to _leaves_. If the word with the _-ing_ itself as an independent noun, it becomes a gerund.

Old Icelandic generally indicates the present participle with a _-and_ suffix and followed by the weak declension

Acc. | gefandi    | gefandi | gefandi
Dat. | gefǫndum    | gefǫndum   | gefǫndum
Gen. | gefandi    | gefandi  | gefandi

## The past participle declension

The past participle expresses an act that has already happened or a process that has been completed. English has a few ways to express a past participle, either with a _-ed_, _-en_ suffixed to the word, or if the verb is strong, with the past tense formation, _sung_. 

> The winds gives me enough __fallen__ leaves to make a fire.
<!--Ryokan-->

The past participle in Old Icelandic functions as a full adjective that is indicated by a specialized declension that has both strong and weak forms. The strong form of _gefa_ follows:

### Gefandi (giver) and bóndi (worker)

This small class of interesting nouns began their lives in Proto-Germanic as present participles. In time, the nominal of these verbs began to to drift from their original meanings and took on lives of their own. These nouns preserve the original weak endings in the singular, but in the plural possess strong masculine endings. [Bóndi](https://old-norse.net/html/b.php#b%C3%B3ndi-1) is actually a contracted form of _buandi_ from the verb, [búa](). The word, [frændi](https://old-norse.net/html/f.php#fr%C3%A6ndi) was developed from an archaic word that disappeared from usage early, [frjá](https://old-norse.net/html/f.php#frj%C3%A1). Of course this word is closely related to English _friend_, which still preserves the participle ending _-nd_, which was also derived from a noun that disappeared from usage. So, the word, really means, "beloved." There's a possibility that the word is also etymologically related to _Frigg_.
