# Grammatical case

If you're already familiar with German, Russian, Hungarian, Latin, or any number of Medieval languages, you're already familiar with noun cases and how they function. If this is your first time learning about them, understanding the grammatical cases is just a matter of knowing how to outline a sentence and knowing what role the nouns play. Take a look at the forms of the Old Icelandic word for "king."

Case | Singular | Plural
-----------------|----------|--------
Nominative       | konungr  | konungar
Accusative    	 | konung   | konunga
Dative           | konungi  | konungum
Genitive         | konungs  | konunga

See where the word changes at the end? That's the case ending, and the thing that tells us how the word works in a sentence. If you can read this, you already know that English nouns change their form depending on number and possession. Consider the English word, _king_. _King_ is the lexical form of the word, but the addition of a suffixed _s_ distinguishes the plural form of the word from the singular.

| Singular  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural |
|---------|--------|
| king    | kings  |

So, we can see here that _-s_ is the English grammatical ending that communicates that the word represents more than one king. So, this is the plural ending. But what about the other cases that run vertically in the chart above for the word, _konungr_?

## The Genitive case

The Genitive case is the case that indicates ownership or close affiliation to another noun. In English it is often also called the possessive case. Possession in English is indicated in two ways. The first and simplest way is with the addition of a new suffixed ending, _-'s_. That's a new grammatical case ending! So we can now build on our English grammar paradigm for the word, _king_. 

| Case &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Singular &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural |
|:-----------------|:----------|:--------|
| Nominative | king | kings  |
| Genitive | king's | kings' |

If you regularly write in English you know that apostrophe in the genitive plural slot can be annoying, but it functions as a way to distinguish plural possessive from the singular possessive. The plural slots are also showing some signs of instability, particularly when a noun already ends with an _s_. Do I type _Russ' frisbee_, or _Russ's frisbee_? The style guides aren't consistent so I will never know which is correct. 

The second way the genitive is expressed in English is with the word, _of_. In the phrase, _The fall of Troy_, there is a possessive relationship between _Troy_ and _fall_. You can rewrite this phrase as, _Troy's fall_, and it does make sense. But the range of meaning between these two English genitives are a little different with other usages. If I wanted to clear up my confusion by writing, "where is the frisbee of Russ?" it would sound a little weird. This is because the _of_ genitive is different and also carries a meaning of affiliation. I am Russ _of_ Seattle. I've read Geoffrey _of_ Monmouth, and I've listened to Gang _of_ Four. This affiliative meaning is covered in the Old Icelandic genitive noun form, but there are prepositions that trigger the genitive case like English, _of_. Those can be found [here](http://rcblack.net/grammar/prepositions/).

## The Nominative case

The other cases in the above paradigm isn't as obvious since English nouns do not change to indicate grammatical function, but that does not mean that the grammatical function is absent. To learn the meanings of these other cases, it's a good idea to know something about how to parse a sentence. Take a look at this very basic sentence:

> Jane paints the fence.

Because the grammatical declensions have gone, English is dependent on word order to give its grammar structure. If you switch the positions of the nouns, meaning is lost.

> The fence paints Jane.

We know from our experience of how paint works that the second sentence does not work. The noun, _Jane_, is the thing that executes the action. In English grammar, _Jane_ must be the subject, and _the fence_ must be the object.

The subject, the noun that executes the action at the front of an English sentence, is the same as the nominative case in declining languages. This is also the reason why meaning breaks down in English if you mess with the word order like we did above. If one changed the noun order in and Old Icelandic sentence, meaning would not be lost.

Think about this. Are you able to construct an English sentence in which the subject of the sentence is in a genitive form with an _-s_ ending? It's impossible because the genitive is a distinct grammatical condition from the nominative. A genitive noun can not be the subject of a sentence.

## The Accusative case

If the nominative case indicates the subject of a sentence, the accusative case then indicates a direct object. Consider again our example with Jane and the fence. The relationship an accusative noun has with the verb is always passive and inactive, and is often the target of that verb's action. _Jane_ is the one who is doing the painting--the nominative subject. The accusative object is _the fence_.  

Now let's look at an Icelandic version of this sentence.

> Katla málar girðinguna.

The lexical forms of these words are [Katla](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Katla), [mála](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/m%C3%A1la), and [girðing](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gir%C3%B0ing). Both nouns in this sentence, _Katla_ and _girðing_, have unique endings that display which grammatical case they are set it. We can see that _Katla_ is in the nominative case, and that _girðing_ has a special ending that displays its "accusativeness." _Katla_, the name of a woman, is the nominative subject, and _girðing_, is the accusative object of this sentence. If we fiddle with the word order like we did with the English sentence above, our act isn't so destructive. 

> Girðinguna málar Katla.

Each noun still contains the endings that signals which word is the subject and which word is the object.

## The Dative case

Now let's take a look at a new sentence.

> Jane gave Dave the bill.

See if you can parse this sentence. What is the subject and what is the object? If you said that the subject is _Jane_ and that the object is _the bill_ you figured it out. But what role does Dave have in this relationship? Dave does receive some action from the verb, but only indirectly. The bill is the thing that is being thrust into his hands. The grammatical condition for the noun, _Dave_ is that it is an **indirect object**. Indirect objects in other languages are associated with the dative case. 

The "dativeness" of _Dave_ can be felt if you apply the preposition _to_ to the noun. 

> Jane gave _to_ Dave the bill.

> I shot _to_ Dave a dirty look. 

"Dativeness" or indirect action with the principle verb also appears in English when a noun accompanies certain prepositions, like in the following examples:

> I painted the fence _for_ Dave.
> I painted the fence _with_ Jane.
> I painted the fence, _with_ my brush.

In all these cases the object remains _the fence_. The other nouns all have an indirect relationship with the principle verb and the subject.

## Prepositions and exceptions

Prepositions play a very important role in all declining Indo-European languages that decline. In the same way that English _of_ can activate the Genitive case and _to_ can activate the indirect objective case, nearly every preposition in Icelandic can trigger any number of the grammatical cases. If you already check out my entry on prepositions [here](http://rcblack.net/grammar/prepositions/), you've already seen what they can do. 

There are also certain cases in which verbs can alter grammatical cases as well. The Icelandic verb, _sakna_, "to miss," always have genitive objects. The word is usually translated into English as, "to feel the loss of." There isn't many of these verbs, but they are always marked in the dictionary.

Another category of verb includes the [copulae](http://rcblack.net/grammar/copula/). These verbs are those in which both the subject and the object are in the nominative case. This includes the word for, "to be."
