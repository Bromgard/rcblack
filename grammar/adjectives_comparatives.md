# Comparatives of adjectives

## Comparative declensions

Comparative adjectives in Icelandic are formed with the same familiar pattern that it witnessed in other Germanic languages as can be seen in the following examples, 

> quick, quicker quickest
> rask, raskere, raskest
> schnell, schneller, am schnellsten

The same pattern appears likewise in Old Icelandic,

> hraðr, hraðari, sem hraðastr

* Note that the superlative form of the adjective, just like the root formation, acts just like a normal adjective and take both weak and strong endings as demanded by the grammar of the sentence. 

* However the comparative formation, _fjótari_ only takes the weak declension.
