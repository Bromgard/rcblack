# The Old Icelandic Adverbs

The _adverb_ is a part of speech that represents a set of words that modify and connect ideas to the verbal component of a sentence. During the Proto-Indo-European period of linguistic development, verbs and their modifiers were organized in two ways. Connecting particles, some of which would be the ancestor particles of what we call prepositions, either connected other words or clauses to the verb adverbially or modified the verb by itself. By the time the Proto-Germanic phase of their development, some of these particles developed into certain particles that connected adjectives or nouns to their verb. These particles normalized into specific suffixes that are attached to adjectives to signal adverbial usage. Other adverbs were developed independently to form dedicated adverbial construction, usually indicating temporal or spacial placement, or the degree of intensity of the verb.

## Suffixed adverbs

The most common adverbial formation that is used for common adverbs is made with one of three suffixes: _-a_, _-i_, _-an_, or _-liga_. Specific suffixes are used for specific adverbs, so these forms must be learned in association to the adjectives that use them.

Take a look at the following forms:

Adjective | Adverb
----------|-------
illr      | illa
gjarn     | gjarna
langr     | lengi
jafn      | jafnan
samr      | saman
harðr			| harðliga
varr      | varliga

The _-liga_ suffix is cognate to the important English adverbial suffix, _-ly_. Both are descended from a Proto-Germanic suffix, _*-likaz_, meaning, "such like," or, "like." So the English word, "lovingly," means, "loving-like." During the saga period, the _-liga_, adverbs were also expressed with the _-a_, suffix, like _harðla_.

An adverbial ending that is formed similarly to _-liga_ is _-eg_ or _-ig_, and is ultimately derived from a contraction from _vegr_, or in English, "way." The word, _þannig_ (thus) comes from the demonstrative pronoun, _þann_, and _hvernig_ (how) comes from (hverr). 

Nouns can often be adverbialized by the addition of the _-liga_ suffix as well. For example, _h&#x1EB;fðingi_ (chieftain) can become _h&#x1EB;fðingliga_ (chieftainly).

## Case ending adverbs

Certain adverbs were formed by the use of the genitive case in certain nouns or adjectives. The adverb, _alls_ (in all) is formed from _allr_. Likewise an adverb can be formed from _lok_ (the end), by forming a genitive, either _loks_, or _loksins_ (in closing). Be sure to pay attention to the natural formations of the nominal. For example, the noun, _staðr_ (place) can form, _allstaðar_ (everywhere). 

Another adverbial formation is formed with the _-um_ particle that was ultimately derived from the dative plural (note that this is still simultaneously a pronoun and a case ending marker in Icelandic). Adjectives like _fyrr_ (first) can become _fyrrum_ (formerly) and _stund_ (span of time) can become _stundum_ (sometimes). Think about the oblique relationship these words would have with their verbs.

Another formation is very similar to participle declension in that the adverb take on a neuter singular ending.

> __Sárt__ ert þú leikinn Sámr fóstri. (Badly art thou treated, Sam, my fosterling.)

## Negation and affirmation

Negation and affirmation were expressed in Old Icelandic with _nei_ and _já, both of which have familiar cognates in the every Germanic language. The negative adverbial suffix is _-gi_, and appears in such words as _eigi_ and _hvergi_. The word, _aldri_ was a contraction of _aldrigi_. In common usage, the generic adverbial negation was either _eigi_ or _ekki_.

## Locative adverbs

Another set of ancient Indo-European adverbial particles were dedicated to the verb's relationship to space and position. The ending, _-i_ indicates a final position, completion of motion, or stasis. The ending _-an_ indicates a spacial relationship away from, or a direction opposite from the direction implied by a root word or particle. These adverbial suffixes are often fixed to prepositions.

Consider the word, _inn_. When suffixed with the locative particle, _inni_, the word adapts a meaning that means something like, "within." Likewise, the word, _innan_ means "from inside," a construction that is relative to a speaker or action that takes place outside. The following words follow this positional pattern. 

root | "in to" | "away from"
-----|---------|----
inn  | inni    | innan
út   |  úti    |   útan
upp  |  uppi   |   ofan
niðr |  niðri  |   neðan
fram |  frammi |   framan
norðr|   --    |  norðan

## Comparison of adverbs

Comparative and superlative forms of the adverbs appear similarly to the forms that are used in every Germanic language. The comparative in Old Icelandic is _-ar_ or _-ara_, and the superlative is expressed, _-ast_. The forms are often expressed in syncopated and alternate forms. Also note the irregular forms. 

root | comparative | superlative
-----|-------------|----
opt    | optar       | optast
hvast  | hvassara    | hvassast
langt,lengi  | lengr(a) | lengst
fjarri | firr  | first
--     | heldr | helzt
nær    | nærr  | næst
lítt   | minnr, miðr | minst
mj&#xEB1;k | meiri | most
vel | betr | bezt
illa | verr | verst
