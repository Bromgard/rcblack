# Adverbs

In Proto-Indo-European adverbs were often formed from nouns pronouns and adjectives whose adjectival function was indicated by particular suffixes. Parts of this suffix system is preserved in Old Icelandic with adverbs that end with _-a_, _-an_, _-i_, and _-liga_. The suffixes are often idiomatic to various categories of nouns. For instance _illr_, and _gjarn_ form the adverbs, _illa_ and _gjarna_. From _langr_ is formed, _lengi_. Likewise, _jafn_ and _samr_ form _jabnan_ and _saman_. Many common adjectives like _harðliga_ and _varligr_ were shortened to _harðla_ and _varla_. The _-liga_ suffix was commonly fixed to nouns to form adverbial constructions, like _hǫfðingliga_.

The negative adverbial suffix is _-gi_; for example, such adverbs as _eigi_, _engi_, _hvergi_. Separate negative elements such as _nei_ or _né_ are also used as was the positive, _já_.

The use of particular grammatical cases were also used to indicate the adverbial function; gen. sing. _alls_ (partative, passing into degree); dat. sing. neut. _miklu_ (degree); acc. sing. _alt_ 'all the way'; dat. pl. _stórum_, _næstum_. Also in the use of nominal adverbs: gen. _stundar_, dat. _stundum_, acc. _megin_.  

## Adverbial Local

The Proto-Indo-European adverbial function of prepositions is preserved with the use of the adverbial suffixes as they were applied to prepositions modifying verbs of motion. The _-i_ suffix indicates completed movement or position after the action. The _-an_ suffix indicates movement away or from the point of view of the utterance. For example, _inn_ 'into', _inni_ 'within', _innan_ 'from within.' the same pattern can be seen in the following forms:

* út, úti, útan
* upp, uppi, ofan
* niðr, niðri, neðan
* fram, frami, framan
* norðr, norðri, norðan
* suðr, suðri, sunnan

Movement or direction to a place was also indicated by the suffix, _-gat_, as in _hingat_ 'hither,' which in turn was derived from _hinn veg at_. corresponding to English, _here--hither--hence_ are

* hér, hingat, heðan
* þar, þangat, þaðan
* hvar, hvert, hvaðan

Direction to a place was also expressed by _hinnig, þannig,_ and _hvernig_.

Motion (and sometimes position) reletive to a point which was neither starting-point nor objective was expressed by _fyrir_ + adverb in _-an_ + accusative, as in _fyrir austan land_. See the usage of _fyrir_ in Prepositions.

## Comparison
