## Reflexive pronouns

A reflexive pronoun is a pronoun the refers back to the noun that is in the nominative case. That is, the pronoun is both the agent and the subject of the verb's action. Take a look at the following sentence:

> Raymond dried himself off after falling into the vat.

The reflexive pronoun in this sentence is, _myself_, which refers back to the subject of the sentence, _Raymond_. Raymond is simultaneously the agent of the verb's action and the object onto which the agency of the verb is being applied. Raymond is simultaneously drying and being dried. 

### First and second person reflexive pronouns

Except for the nominative case, all the first and second person personal pronouns listed above can function as reflexive pronouns. (If you think about it, it's impossible for a reflexive pronoun to be in the nominative case, because by definition it needs to reflex the action of the verb to the nominative.) 

### Third person reflexive pronouns

The Third person reflexives have their own distinct forms as seen below. All of these work for any gender in both singular and plural cases.

Case | 3rd.
-----|----
Acc. | sik
Dat. | sér
Gen. | sín

### The reflexive possessive pronoun

This pronoun, _sinn_ can be translated as, "her own," "his own," or, "its own," regardless of the gender of the nominative subject. Some resources list this with the possessive pronouns. It has an adjectival declension that looks similar to, _minn_. Compare the declensions.
