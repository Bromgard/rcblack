# The Copula

## The Substantive Copula

The word, _copula_, is a Latin word that translates into English to mean a harness, leash, or some kind of connecting rope or bond. Grammarians adopted the word to also describe the verb, _sum_, the Latin word that is best translated into English as _to be_, or _is_. Let's take a look at this simple sentence:

>Hope is the thing with feathers.

The subject of this sentence is "hope," and the verb is the word, "is." But, "the thing with feathers," is not he object of the sentence. It does not receive the action of, "hope." In fact there is no action at all, it's simply the same thing. If you switch the two items,

>The thing with feathers is hope.

It means exactly the same thing. In this case the item that follows the verb is called the _subject compliment_. In reality, the predicate construction is simply a way to adjectivally describe the subject. The compliment can also be an adjectival prepositional phrase.

>Love is in the air, everywhere I look around.

The conjugation of _be_, or _is_ in English is as follows:

| Person | Present | Past |
|:-------|:-------:|-----:|
| Sg. 1  | am      | was  |
| Sg. 2  | are     | were |
| Sg. 3  | is      | was  |
| Pl. 1,2,3  | are     | were |

If you already know a Scandinavian language you already know that the indicative conjugation for the copula has been reduced by number so that the only forms remaining are _er_ in the present case and _var_ for the past (_är_ and _var_ in Swedish). 

In many languages that decline such as Latin, German, and Old Icelandic, the grammatical case is always the nominative on both sides of the copula. Look at the following popular German Sentence:

>__Ich__ bin __ein Berliner__. (I am a Berliner.)

_Ich_ is the personal pronoun meaning, "I" and _bin_ is the German copula that means "am." The subjuctival compliment is the rest of the sentence, "a Berliner." Both "ich" and "ein Berliner," A noun that means a resident of Berlin preceded by the indefinite article, are both in the nominative case. This will likewise always be the case whenever you see the Old Icelandic copula. The substantive verb, _vera_ conjugates like this. (Compare this with the archaic English construction, _thou art_.)

### Indicative

| Person | Present | Past |
|:-------|:-------:|-----:|
| Sg. 1  | em      | var  |
| Sg. 2  | ert     | vart |
| Sg. 3  | er      | var  |
| Pl. 1  | erum    | várum|
| Pl. 2  | eruð    | váruð|
| Pl. 3  | eru     | váru |

### Subjunctive 

| Person | Present | Past |
|:-------|:-------:|-----:|
| Sg. 1  | sé      | væra |
| Sg. 2  | sér     | værir|
| Sg. 3  | sé      | væri |
| Pl. 1  | sém     | værim|
| Pl. 2  | séð     | værið|
| Pl. 3  | sé      | væri |

Take a look at the following sentence from Olaf's saga Trygvasson:

>__Ek__ em útlendr __maðr__ hér, segir hann. (I am a foreign man here.)

The substantive copula here is _em_. The subject is the pronoun, _ek_, and the identifying compliment noun is _maðr_. Note that _ek_ is the nominative singular pronoun. The Old Icelandic noun, _maðr_ is a strong masculine noun in its singular nominative formation. The verb formation is likewise in agreement with the nominal formation in the sentence in that it relays the singular present tense. Make note of the strong masculine nominative inflexion in the adjective, _útlendr_. Like the examples above, the substantive construction links the subject with itself by simply describing a equivalence by linking _ek_ and _útlandr maðr_. 

Now take a look at the following sentence from a genealogy from _Landnámabók_:

>__Sonr__ Bjǫrnólfs var __Ǫrn__, __faðir__ þeira Ingólfs ok Helgu, en __Hróaldsson__ var __Hróðmarr__, __faðir__ Leifs. (The son of Bjornolf was Orn, the father of Ingolf and Helgi, but Hroald's son was Hrothmar, Leif's father.)

The substantive copula in this sentence is of course, _var_, which occurs twice in in this compound sentence that is linked by the conjunction, _en_. The words that are in the nominative case are indicated. The words, _sonr_ and _faðir_  both contain strong nominative formations. (Hyperlink to declension of _faðir_?) In order to parse the rest of the sentence, it's useful to know something about the declensions of the other nouns. _Ǫrn_ is a proper name that means "Eagle," a word that declines like this:

| Case | Noun |
|:-----|-----:|
| Nom. | Ǫrn  |
| Acc. | Ǫrn  |
| Dat. | Erni |
| Gen. | Arnar|

You can easily exclude both the dative and genitive cases but we know that noun compliment _faðir_ is in the nominative case. _Hróðmarr_ is also in the nominative case. (Link. See Declension of Old Icelandic proper names.) You may have noticed that the patronymic name _Hróaldsson_ does not appear to agree with the earlier incidence of _sonr_ which contains a strong masculine nominative ending. In many modern editions and in the manuscripts, one will often find the patronymic ending separately like this: _Hróalds son_, but nevertheless this suffixed occurrence of _son_ lost the strong ending _-r_ by the time this manuscript was written. In this example, _Hróaldsson_ is nevertheless also in the nominative case. His complete name is, _Hróðmarr Hróaldsson_.

## Other Copula Verbs

### _heita_

There are other verbs in Old Icelandic that act like the substantive copula. A version of the following sentence occurs in nearly every Icelandic saga.

>__Oddr__ hét __maðr__. (A man is named Oddr.)

The verb, _hét_, lexical form, _heita_, is actually difficult to translate because English utilizes a passive construction with the auxiliary _be_. (Link to passive formations.) Just like the substantive copula above, the words, _Oddr_, and _maðr_, represent the same thing. The two words are linked by the specific usage of this verb. Be aware that this verb also carries additional transitive usages in which the verb does not have a copular function as we can see here. 

>Kjartan hét þessu. (Kjartan promised this.)

The dative demonstrative article tells us that the verb carries a different function. Consultation with a dictionary will tell you the proper lexical usage.

### _kalla_

Another verb that appears less frequently in its copular form in Old Icelandic is, _kalla_. This usage of this word is very similar to its English cognate, _call_, which likewise carries a very similar meaning to _heita_. 

>Hárr segir, "Þórr er þeirra framast, __sá__ er kallaðr __Ása-Þórr__, eða __Ǫku-Þórr__. (Hárr says, "Thor is the foremost of them, he who is called Æsir-Thor or Ukko-Thor.)[^1]

[^1]: It's not clear why these alternate names for Thor appears like this. According to Cleasby-Vigfusson, _Ǫku-Þórr_ appears to be a reference to the Finnish thunder god, Ukko, which may be here differentiated from the Thor-of-the-Æsir.

The word, __sá__ is naturally the nominative masculine demonstrative pronoun. Both of these versions of Thor's name, _Þórr_, is a strong nominative declension of his Name. Like _heita_, _kalla_ also appears in a transitive form that does not precede a nominative object.

### _verða_

This common word in it's copular formations means, _become_. Unlike the above examples, this word implies that the object has undergone some kind of change, but the predicate often maintains the nominative form. The following complex sentence comes from Snorri's telling of how the first batch of mead was brewed from the blood of the god, Kvasir. 

>Þeir blendu hunangi við blóðit ok __varð__ þar af __mjǫðr sá__, er __hverr__ er af drekkr verðr __skáld__ eða __frœðamaðr__. (They blended honey with the blood that thereof became mead, that whosoever drinks from it becomes a poet or a learned man.)

The word, _verða_ occurs twice in this sentence. In English syntax, the clause that follows, 'They blended honey with the blood, would require the dependent article "which," that is, the nominative pronoun that represents the mixture. The nominatives in the clause are the nominative predicatd, _mjǫðr sá_. The second clause contains a clear nominative singular subject, __hverr__ and predicate, __skáld__ or __frœðamaðr__.

As with the previous examples, this word also appears transitively in other usages. Predicate nominative formations do not always accompany these words but it's always useful to recognize them when you see them in your reading. As always consult the dictionary often when you read.
