### Adjective usage in Old Icelandic

The usage of strong and weak declensions is consistent with their usage in modern German. When standing alone as a modifier to a noun, the adjective always takes the strong ending.

> __Eiríkr alspakr__ hét __lendr maðr__ í Nóregi. ([A] landed man is named Eirík All-wise.)
<!--_Egla_, chapt. 64-->

This sentence contains two simple noun-adjective pairs, __Eiríkr alspakr__, and __lendr maðr__. The word, _lendr_ is an adjective that carries the strong nominative adjective ending in parallel with _maðr_. The other noun-adjective pairing, _Eiríkr alspakr_ that begins the sentence, likewise displays two strong nominative endings. Note that the nouns precede their adjectives.

The weak endings become active in proximity to the noun when it follows either a demonstrative pronoun or the definite article. Take a look at the following sentence:

> Sigldi hann fyrst í Austrveginn, ok varð honum bæði gott til fjár ok mannorðs, en aldri lá hann svá vakandi, at væri eigi honum fyrir augum __sú fagra h&#x1EB;nd__ ok __þat væna gull__, sem hann missti í Aldeigjuborg. (First he sailed to Russia, and did well in both wealth and reputation, but never while he lay awake, would there not be before his eyes that beautiful hand and that lovely gold, which he lost in Staraya Ladoga.)
<!--Hálfdanar Saga Eysteinsson, 10-->

There are two nominal clusters used in this sentence. The noun, _h&#x1EB;nd_ is modified by the demonstrative _sú_, which communicates strong grammatical declination of the feminine noun. The adjective, _fagra_ therefore takes the weak ending. The same thing likewise occurs in the second construction. The noun, _gull_ is a neuter noun that is modified by the demonstrative, _þat_. Because it follows the demonstrative, the adjective _væna_ is suffixed by a weak adjective declension.

The weak adjective endings are also used when grammatical case is already indicated by the definite article. 

> F&#x1EB;rum til skipa tíðast, þar siglir nú __Ormr inn langi__ austan. (Let us go as soon as possible, the Long Dragon sails there now.)
<!--Fagrskinna, Olaf T. ch. 24-->

Notice how the definite article detaches from the noun. When in this position, particularly with proper nouns, the sequence is often translated with the English article following the noun and preceding the adjective. As expected, the adjective takes a weak ending because of its proximity to the definite article.

> Hans sonr var __Ormr inn sterki__. (His son was Dragon the strong.)
<!--Egla 23-->
<!--__Inn helgi Jón byskup__ hafði skamma stund at stóli setit at Hólum áðr en hann lét leggja ofan kirkju þá er þar var. Jóns saga helga, 8-->

A common anomalous adjective is _samr_. This verb often functions with it's weak endings even if there is no definite formation or demonstrative present. For example, 

> Hirðmenn hafa nú __sama vanða__, ok kasta fyrst smám beinum um þvert gólfit til b&#x1EB;ðvars ok Hattar (The hirð men now display the same behavior, and first threw small bones across the floor toward Boðvar and H&#x1EB;ttr.)

Other adjective to remember is, _annarr_, and _allr_. These were always strong no matter their position.

> Þá spurði hann þau tiðendi, at Sveinn konungr var kominn til Sjálandz ok þá var kominn til hans __herr sjá allr__. (Then he learned these tidings, that King Sveinn came to Zealand, and __that entire army__ came to him.)

A partitive adjective construction also exists in a similar sense in English in which one might say, "He drank half of the bottle." Note that this construction does not utilize the genitive case.

> Ek á nu __hálft eitt dýrit__. (I now have half of an animal.)

## Declension of Adjectives in Old Icelandic

Overall, the adjective declensions are very similar to the nouns. Like the nouns they decline by gender and number, and many of the formation closely resemble the noun declensions. Unlike the nouns, each adjective uses both the strong and weak declension depending on the presence of other modifiers in the sentence. The rules for this are discussed above. As always there are a few differences between the adjectival and noun endings. As you read, be sure you make note of them as you find them as you find them.
