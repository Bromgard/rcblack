# Overview of the grammatical aspects of Verbs

Just as Old Icelandic nouns are conditioned by _case_, _number_, _gender_, and _definiteness_. Old Icelandic verbs are likewise conditioned by, _person_, _number_, _tense_, _mood_, and _voice_. Old Icelandic verbal inflections communicate more information than modern Scandinavian languages or English. For this reason the full conjugation charts of Old Icelandic verbs rather large. If you know German or if you already have some knowledge of Latin, much of this will already be familiar to you.

## Person

This quality in Old Icelandic operates in precisely the same way as modern English. The primary persons in Icelandic are the familiar _first_, _second_, and _third_ persons. The person aspect in English can often be recognized the personal pronoun that can be used in the subject. _First Person_ is expressed in the sentence, _I sing._ _Second Person_ indicates action of a person who is addressed by the utterer, _You sing_. _Third Person_ indicates the activity that is external and independent from the utterance itself, as can be seen in, _She sings._.

<!--
Some linguists consider the functioning of the familiar "thou" in English and "du" in German (as opposed to "you" and "Sie") to be indicative of an independent _Second Person Familiar_ because the verb likewise changes to express the new condition. The changes in this case are closely associated with the verb's _number_.

The English substantive copula inflects in person in the following formations. 

| Person    | Form |
|:----------|-----:|
| 1st  | am   |
| 2nd  | are  |
| 3rd  | is   |


For other English nouns, the only variable inflection that represents person is a suffixed _-s_ in third person singular. 

| Person    | Form |
|:----------|-----:|
| 1st  | sing   |
| 2nd  | sing |
| 3rd  | sings   |

Aside from a few regional dialects, Norwegian, Danish, or Swedish do not inflect for person. Old Icelandic verbs inflect consistently for person, as you can see in this following paradigm for _hafa_, (to have). 

| Person    | Form |
|:----------|-----:|
| 1st Sing. | hefi |
| 2nd Sing. | hefir|
| 3rd Sing  | hefir|

## Number

As in English, the formation of Old Icelandic verbs must agree with the number aspect of the accompanying subjective noun, either _singular_ or _plural_. The English verbs do not have any distinguishing inflections.

| Person    | Form |
|:----------|-----:|
| 1st Pl. | are   |
| 2nd Pl. | are |
| 3rd Pl. | are   |

The continental Scandinavian languages do not inflect at all for number. Old Icelandic still expresses distinct inflections for number. 

| Person    | Form |
|:----------|-----:|
| 1st Sing. | hefi |
| 2nd Sing. | hefir|
| 3rd Sing  | hefir|
| 1st Pl.   | hǫfum|
| 2nd. Pl.  | hafið|
| 3rd. Pl   | hafa |

Another number aspect, the _dual_, is also present in Old Icelandic that represents two subjective nouns. The pronouns are, _vit_ (we two), and  _þit_ (you two). However the verbal system simply utilized the plural. For more details see [Personal Pronouns]. [Link]

## Tense

Icelandic, as with all other Germanic languages, contain only two inflected tenses, the _Simple Present_ and the _Simple Past_. Germanic nouns are also characterized by division of two categories of verbs, strong and weak. The weak verbs display change in tense by the addition of suffixes. In English, simple verbs mark the past tense with an _-ed_ suffix, like _danced_. Strong vowels display tense by a change in an internal vowel, for example _sing_ and _sang_. Similar patterns are also apparent in the other Scandinavian cognate verbs including Old Icelandic as can be seen in the following words related to English _sing_. 

| Tense   | Engl.| Nor.  | Dan.   | Swed.  | Old. Ice.    |
|:--------|:----:|:-----:|:------:|:------:|------:|
| Present | sing | synger| synger | sjunger| syng  |
| Past    | sang | sang  | sang   | sjöng  | sǫng  |

This internal change is called _ablaut_ and as you can see, Icelandic is no different in marking this change. The system of suffixed changed that marks weak verbs can be seen in the following paradigm. 

| Tense   | Engl.  | Nor.   | Dan.    | Swed.   | Old Ice.  |
|:--------|:------:|:------:|:-------:|:-------:|--------:|
| Present | dance  | danser | danser  | dansar  | dansa   |
| Past    | danced | danset | dansede | dansade | dansaði |

It is interesting to note that all of these words share a common ancestor with Old French, _dancier_, a word that moved north with the spread of courtly culture in the High Middle ages. Verbs imported from other languages adopt the weak tense systems in Germanic languages. 

The other tenses in Germanic languages do not have a natural system of inflections but make use of synthetic constructions that make use of auxiliary verbs. For example, the perfect tenses in English require the use of the auxiliary verb, _have_, followed by the past participle of the verb. (Hyperlink to PP)

>I __have seen__ better faces in my time.

The difference between the present perfect tense and the simple past is sometimes subtle, but the meaning is always relative to the context of the present condition from the point of view of the utterer. The act of seeing is something that has been completed sometime in the past. In this case the utterer is comparing his previous experience of faces with one particular face. The completion of the previous acts are being emphasized. If we compare this sentence with a simple past construction, 

>I __saw__ her laid low in her family's vault.

The sentence here simply records a fact that occurred one particular time, and provides no relative context to a present state. The use of this auxiliary is universal in the Germanic languages. 

| Eng. | Dan. | Old. Ice. |
|:-----|:--:|---:|
|I have seen. | Jeg har set. | Ek hefi sét. |

There are other perfect constructions that use synthetic auxiliary verbs that will be discussed in greater detail in a later lesson. [Hyperlink]

Like other Germanic languages the future tense is indicated also by the synthetic constructions that make use of auxiliary modal verbs.

>I __will__ __live__ in thy heart, __die__ in thy lap, and __be buried__ in thy eyes.

As you can see the word, _will_ contextually triggers the future tense of three verbs. This construction has a similar cognate construction in Danish. 

>Jeg vil dø. (I will die.)

The Old Icelandic modal auxiliary that most often triggers the future tense is _munu_. 

>Dýrit __mun__ __deyja__ fyrir þér. (The animal will die before you.)

The auxiliary verb _mun_ works in the same way. The synthesis of this verb with the infinitive form of _deyja_ (die) work together to tell us, in this case warn us, that something will happen in the future. The use modal verbs will be discussed in greater detail in our lesson on modal verbs. [Hyperlink]

## Mood

There are three moods in the Old Icelandic verbal system, the _indicative_, the _subjunctive_, and the _imperative_ moods. The _indicative_ mood communicates a simple action that takes place in the real world of the text. This much like a many of the simple sentences that we have already seen before.

>Maðr hét Auðunn.

And so on. The _subjunctive_ mood differentiates itself from the _indicative_ in that it communicates a thing that has potential, possibility, doubt, or a wish. In other words, something that doesn't have any actuality in the world of the text in that moment. The only inflected case that communicates the subjunctive in English is in the third person singular formation. Look at the English paradigm above in our discussion on verbal person. We already know that the English third person inflection for _sing_ is _sings_.

>Will no one tell me what she __sings__?
<!--Wordsworth, the solitary reaper-->

The subjunctive is indicated by the loss of the _-s_ inflection. 

>A humorous suggestion was made that she __sing__ the notes on her face.
<!--Great Gatsby-->

A couple of things are apparent with this construction in English. This kind of subjunctive generally appears in dependent clauses (beginning with _that_), and another verb or verb construction operates like an auxiliary. (I __suggest__ that she sing. She __asked__ that she sing.)

A similar pattern can be seen with the substantive copula, _be_.

>It __is__. 

The subjunctive mood shifts the English conjugation. 

>Let it __be__.

This last last sentence is in the form of a request, or a command. In either case, the actuality of the verbal action is not yet realized, is a potential set in the future, or a wish that has not yet happened. Note also the use of the auxiliary, _let_.

The English subjunctive can also be communicated with the use of certain modal verbs. 

>I __might call__ him a thing divine.
<!--Tempest-->

>If I __could pray__ to move, prayers __would move__ me.
<!--Julius Caesar-->

[Include continental Scand. example?]

The subjunctive mood is expressed in Old Icelandic with its own system of declensions for each verb and are generally marked by weak changes in ablaut and declension. The Old Icelandic substantive copula, _vera_, has an inflection that looks like this.

#### Present

| Pers.    | Sing. | Pl. |
|:---------|:-----:|----:|
| 1st sing.| sé    | sém |
| 2nd      | sér   | séð |
| 3rd      | sé    | sé  |

#### Past

| Pers.    | Sing. | Pl.   |
|:---------|:-----:|------:|
| 1st sing.| væra  | værim |
| 2nd      | værir | værið |
| 3rd      | væri  | væri  |

>"Hvat mun þetta tákna?" Snorri svarar honum: "Vera kann at þetta __sé__ friðartákn ok tǫkum skjǫld hvítan ok berum í mót. ("What can this mean?" Snorri replied, "It may be a sign of peace, so let us take a white shield and lift it up in return.") 

This formation, _sé_, communicates the subjunctive mood without the help of context or synthetic constructions. Now compare the present indicative and subjunctive conjugations of the verb, _segja_ (to say).

#### Indicative

| Pers.    | Sing. | Pl. |
|:---------|:-----:|----:|
| 1st sing.| segi    | segjum |
| 2nd      | segir   | segið |
| 3rd      | segir  | segja |

#### Subjunctive

| Pers.    | Sing. | Pl.   |
|:---------|:-----:|------:|
| 1st sing.| segja  | segim |
| 2nd      | segir | segið |
| 3rd      | segi  | segi  |

Like English, the inflection for the third person singular is strong and is expressed by a suffixed, _-i_. The distinctive inflections in first and third person plural, _-im_ and _-i_ are also easy to remember. 

>Bragi svarar: "Ǫlvaldi hét faðir hans, ok merki munu þér at þykkja ef ek __segi__ þér frá honum. (Bragi says, "His father was named Olvaldi, you would find it amazing, if I tell you about him".)

The context of this sentence helps construct a subjunctive environment. As in English, the _if_ (...ef ek...) clause sets up the mood, and the inflection of _segi_ confirms unrealized nature of the action.

The _imperative_ mood represents another distinct inflection in Old Icelandic verbs. In practice, the mood appears in a command, or a request that something be accomplished on the part of the recipient of the utterance. In English these formations are very closely related to the subjunctive, and are sometimes indistinguishable. When the substantive copula is used the form _be_ is used. 

>__Be__ prepared. 

You may have noticed that _Let it be_ has also has an imperative quality. When other verbs are used in English a simple second person conjugation is used. 

>__Tell me__, where is fancy bred, or in the heart or in the head?

The imperative forms of Old Icelandic verbs are always included in a complete paradigm. The Old Icelandic imperative forms for the substantive copula are, singular _ver_, and plural _verið_. 

>En þér, Auðunn, kann ek slíka þǫkk, sem þú gæfir mér allt dýrit. __Ver__ hér með mér. (For you AuðunnI will thank you as though you had given me the whole bear. Be here with me. (That is, "stay with me."))

As you read, be sure to be prepared to recognize the imperative inflections for other words as well.Let's take one more look at this sentence from _Eiríkś saga rauða_. 

>"Hvat mun þetta tákna?" Snorri svarar honum: "Vera kann at þetta sé friðartákn ok __tǫkum__ skjǫld hvítan ok __berum__ í mót. ("What can this mean?" Snorri replied, "It may be a sign of peace, so let us take a white shield and lift it up in return.") 

These are the imperative formations for the verbs, _taka_ (take) and _bera_ (bear; hold) for the first person plural. For comparison, the first person plural imperative in English is used in the following sentence. 

>Let's go!

Since English does not have verbal inflexions that represent imperative, so it must rely on the auxiliary _let_. See the English translation in the previous Old Icelandic quotation. 

### Voice [Come back to this after you figure out how to deal with mediopassive]

Old Icelandic verbs have three voices, the _active_, _passive_, and the _middle_ voices. The _active voice_ is the condition in which the sentence communicates a simple action that is expressed by the verb that has been enabled by the nominative subject.

John paints the house.

This is a simple active sentence. In a sentence written in the _passive_ voice, the nominative subject is removed from the first position and the object takes the first position in the sentence.

The house is painted.

Or,

The house is painted by John.

The _middle_ voice is the reflexive form that end with the -sk ending. Barnes reports that this voicing has some similarities with the passive voice. This construction often expresses a simple active reflexive action, but overall the usage of this voice is also idiomatic. The term was coined by linguists to describe a grammatical voice that was in between the passive and active voice. For more details, see the lesson that covers mediopassive voice.
