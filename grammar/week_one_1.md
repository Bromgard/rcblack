## The Parts of the Old Icelandic Noun

If you can read this you already know that English nouns change their form depending in number and the possession. Consider the English word, _king_. _King_ is the lexical formation of the word, but the addition of a suffixed _s_ distinguishes the plural form of the word from the singular.

| Singular  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural |
|---------|--------|
| king    | kings  |

English also use a suffixed ending that communicates the genitive, or the possessive case.

| Case &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Singular &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural |
|:-----------------|:----------|:--------|
| Nominative | king | kings  |
| Genitive | king's | kings' |

The inflexions for the English word is relatively simple. In spoken speech the word seems to have only two form, a primary form and a secondary form that supplies an 's' sound at the end of the word. Context within the sentence, such as the conjugation of the verb, differentiates the differences between possessive and plural usages. In the orthography of written language, the apostrophe preserves an historical formation from the Middle English genitive ending, '-es.'

The Swedish grammatical formation of _konung_ is stronger in that the distinctions between the genitive (possessive) case and the plural are more distinct than the formations in English. 

Case | Singular | Plural
-----------------|----------|--------
Nominative       | konung   | konungar
Genitive	 | konungs  | konungars

The Old Icelandic noun _konungr_ inflexes to communicate the four grammatical cases. 

Case | Singular | Plural
-----------------|----------|--------
Nominative       | konungr  | konungar
Accusative	 | konung   | konunga
Dative           | konungi  | konungum
Genitive         | konungs  | konunga

Depending on its grammatical function, the Old Icelandic noun will display the matching suffix:

>Konungr tók vel kveðju hans. (The king took his greeting well.)

Notice that the nominative noun is in first position and the verb is in second. Whenever you see this suffixed strong ending, you know that you have found a nominative singular strong noun. The king is the agent that is performing the action of the verb, _tók_. Now that we know the grammatical paradigm for _konungr_, we can spot the grammatical case when we find the word elsewhere in our reading. 

>Þú hafir fundit Svein konung. (You have met King Svein.)

In this sentence, the subject (nominative) is _þú_ and is in first position. The verbal construction is _havir fundit_, which is in second position. _Svein konung_ is the object of the sentence, so the noun takes the appropriate ending, which in this case is none at all.

>Varðmenn sǫgðu konungi at dýrit fari þar. (The watchmen said to the king that the animal is coming there.

In this sentence, _konungi_ adopts the dative case ending. _Varðmenn_ is the subject and _sǫgðu_ is the verb in second position. The word, _konungi_ is the indirect object taking the dative case. The watchmen told the news _to_ the king.

## The Suffixed Definite Article

If you already know a Scandinavian language, then you are already acquainted with the suffixed definite article. The English definite article, _the_, does not decline and always precedes the accompanying noun. In Scandinavian languages, the definite article performs very much the same function, but appears as an additional particle suffixed to the accompanying noun. Let's take another look at the Swedish noun, _konung_, this time with the suffixed article.

Case | Sing.    | Sing. Definite | Plural   | Plural Definite
-----------------|----------|----------------|----------|----------------
Nominative       | konung   | konungen       | konungar | konungarna
Genitive	 | konungs  | konungens      | konungars| konungarnas

The rules governing this paradigm are easy to parse. The articles are suffixed to reflect the needed case and number. The genitive enclitic, _-s_ always appears at he end of the word even when the suffixed article is present.

The Old Icelandic definite article likewise follows a stronger declension that also reflects the grammatical cases. 

| Case &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Sing. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Sing. Def. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Plural Def.|
|:------------------|:----------|:------------|:----------|:-------------|
| Nominative       | konungr  | konungrinn | konungar | konungarnir |
| Accusative	   | konung   | konunginn  | konunga  | konungana   |
| Dative           | konungi  | konunginum | konungum | konungunum  |
| Genitive         | konungs  | konungsins | konunga  | konunganna  |

Notice that the construction of the case endings along with the definite article is very regular. Note the particles that make up the definite noun, _konungrinn_:

| Stem  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| Case Suffix &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| Def. Article |
|:--------|:------------:|:-------------|
| konung- | -r          | -inn         |

When the noun appears in the nominative case, the _-r_ ending is always present after the stem, even when the definite suffix is also present.

>Konungrinn leit eptir honum. (The king looked him over.)

The presence of the _-r_ in _konungrinn_ tells you that the king in this sentence is unambiguously the agent of the action and in the nominative case. Compare this sentence with the following exchange. 

>Bolli spyrr: "Hvat viltu gera?" (Bolli asks him, "What will you do?"
>
>"Ekki mun ek því leyna," segir Kjartan, "brenna konunginn inni." ("I will not hide this from you," says Kjartan, "To burn the king inside.)

In this formation, since _konunginn_ does not contain the nominative ending _-r_, we know that the word is in the accusative case and therefore the object of _brenna_. The king is the object of Kjartan's intent to ignite his quarters and murder him in his sleep.
