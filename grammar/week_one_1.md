## The Parts of the Old Icelandic Noun

If you can read this you already know that English nouns change their form depending in number and in a certain grammatical case. Consider the English word, _king_. _King_ is the lexical formation of the word, but the addition of a suffixed _s_ distinguishes the plural form of the word from the singular

 Singular | Plural  
----------|--------|
 king     | kings

English also use a suffixed ending that communicates the genitive, or the possessive case.

Grammatical Case | Singular | Plural
-----------------|----------|--------
Subjective/Objective | king | kings
Possessive | king's | kings'

The inflexions for the English word is relatively simple. In spoken speech the word seems to have only two form, a primary form and a secondary form that supplies an 's' sound at the end of the word. Context within the sentence, such as the conjugation of the verb, differentiates the differences between possessive and plural usages. In the orthography of written language, the apostrophe preserves an historical formation from the Middle English genitive ending, '-es.'

The Swedish grammatical formation of _konung_ is stronger in that the distinctions between the genitive (possessive) case and the plural are more distinct than the formations in English. 

Grammatical Case | Singular | Plural
-----------------|----------|--------
Nominative       | konung   | konungar
Genitive	 | konungs  | konungars

The Old Icelandic noun _konungr_ inflexes to communicate the four grammatical cases. 

Grammatical Case | Singular | Plural
-----------------|----------|--------
Nominative       | konungr  | konungar
Accusative	 | konung   | konunga
Dative           | konungi  | konungum
Genitive         | konungs  | konunga
