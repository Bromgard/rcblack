# Saga of Gisli Sursson

## English translation of the variant introduction from the long version, from AM 149 fol. 

## 1

It is at the beginning of this saga that Harald Fairhair ruled Norway. He was the first sovereign king over all Norway, and because of him there came to be many exiles to various lands. And there were also powerful men among the exiles because they did not wish to endure his tyranny, yet they didn't have the strength to challenge him. In the days of King Harald, Iceland was discovered and settled. The children of Ketil Flatnose journeyed here. Among them were Bjorn the Easterner, from whom the Kjallakar are descended. And Helgi Bjolan, who settled in Kjalarnes. And Thorunn Hyrna, who married Helgi the Lean in Eyjafjord. From them come the Eyfirthingar. Aud, Ketil's daughter, finally journeyed here, and from her family comes the Earls of Orkney, the Gautuskeggjar in the Faroe Islands, and the Breidfyrthingar here in Iceland. Thorolf Mostur-beard also journeyed here, and he took all of Thorsness land, and from him the Snorrungar are descended. Ulfr the Squinter journeyed here and he took Reykjanes in Breidafjord, and the Reyknesingar are descended from him. Thord the Viking journeyed here. He came into Dyrafjord and took all the land on the southern side. Hrollaug, the son of Ragnvald the Earl of Maeri, and the brother of Earl Turf-Einar, Thorir the Silent, and Göngu-Hrolf, journeyed here and took land east of Síða, and from him are descended the people of Síða.

In that time there was a powerful hersir in Norway who was named Thorkel, and he was nicknamed Gullhjalmr. He was married in Sunnhordaland in Surnadal, and he had three sons with his wife. The oldest was named Ari, another of his sons was Gisli, and the third was Thorbjorn. They were all promising men. The name of the man who ruled over Fjardafylki is Isi. His daughter is named Ingibjorg. Ari Thorkelsson asked for her hand in marriage, and so she was given to him. From her he acquired much wealth. One man named Kol accompanied her. He came from a prominent family, but he was abducted and so he was considered a slave. He travelled with Ingibjorg to Surnadal. Thorkel gives a rich farmstead to this son Ari, and he takes control of the farm there in the valley. He appears to be a most promising man.

That man is named in the saga who is called Bjorn. He was called Bjorn the Black. He was a berserker and a great dueller. There were also twelve others who accompanied him. Bjorn was skilled in magic, and so instruments of iron never cut him. He was unpopular with everyone. He settled himself into the house of the men who appealed to him. Furthermore he lay in bed with their wives and daughters, and did for himself whatever suited him at such a time. Everyone was anxious when he came, and they rejoiced when he left.

It is told that Bjorn learned that Ari brought a beautiful woman to his farmstead and that he received an easy inheritance. He considers it advantageous to go to that place. He turns in that direction with his gang and arrives there one day in the evening. Ari and Bjorn, along with the other Berserkers, meet each other. Bjorn says that he intends to take management of the farmstead for himself, and that he intends to have his wife Ingibjorg in the same bed as he. After such a time that he saw fit, Bjorn asked Ari to do whatever he thought better, to go away or stay there. Ari declares that that he will not leave and that he did not plan for him to have any control over the farmstead. 

"Very good!" Bjorn says, "but there is another choice. I will challenge you to a duel if you agree to a delay of three days. In that time, each of us will try to take Ingibjorg, and he who takes victory in the duel shall also take wealth from the other. I will not surrender any wealth in this duel, indeed I always take wealth from my opponent."

Ari says that he will eagerly fight. The Berserkers departed at this time, and they then prepared for the duel. They come now onto the duelling site, and their dealings conclude in that Ari is killed. Yet the berserker receives no wounds because the iron did not bite. Now Bjorn considers himself to have won the land, the moveable property, and the wife. He makes it known publicly that he plans to go to that farm that Ari used to own that same evening.

Ari's brother Gisli answers soon after all this happened.
<!--Revisit this. I'm not convinced I got it.-->
"If this horrible thing comes to pass, misery will overcome us all. Now this can never happen. I will challenge you to a duel first thing in the morning. I would much rather die in a duel than endure this calamity."

Bjorn says, "That is good! You will put an end to your entire family if you intend to risk doing battle with me."<!--fara=put an end? Revisit this too.-->

After this they parted and Gisli goes home to the farm that Ari had. The news about the duel got around, as did the passing of Ari, and everyone thought that ownership of the estate was lost. Gisli goes to meet wtih Ingibjorg and tells her about the passing of Ari, that he challenged Bjorn to a duel, and that they must fight tomorrow.

"That is a miserable plan," says Ingibjorg, "and I fear that to you will not do well unless you make use of the help of others." 

Gisli says, "I will ask you, or anyone else, for help. If it is most likely that whatever you propose will contribute to my cause, then victory might be more likely than it would otherwise."

"There is a certain man," says Ingibjorg, "who appears most likely to know how to contribute to this case in a way that the advantage might come to you."

"Who is that?," says Gisli.

"Kol, my fosterling is he," she says, "I believe that he might have a certain sword, which shall be better than any other. However he makes it out to be without worth, and he calls it his hacking blade."

And now Kol was sent for and he comes to meet Gisli and Ingibjorn. Gisli said, "You have a rather good sword."

Kol replies, "My sword is a small treasure, however there are many things in a churl's house that is not in a king's stronghold."

Gisli said, "Will you not loan me the sword for the duel against Bjorn?"

Kol spoke,
"Now you will act like so many people when someone possesses a valuable thing and the owner cannot bear to give it away.
But I will tell you now, that the sword will cut anything it strikes, whether it is made of iron or anything else. It cannot be dulled because it is forged by dwarves. The sword is named Grasida (Grey-blade).
And you must expect that I will be displeased if I cannot take the sword when I wish to hold it."

"On the other hand it is not right," says Gisli, "that you hold onto your sword while I have had such dire need for it."

So now Gisli takes the sword and night passes. Before they leave home for the duel, Thorbjorn asks his brother Gisli, "Brother, who among us should fight the berserker today, and who should slaughter the calf?"

Gisli answers, "I recommend that you slaughter the calf, then Bjorn and I will do battle."[^1]

[^1]: According to some sources, the Holmgang ritual included an animal sacrifice.

He did not make the easy choice. They go went then to the dueling site. Gisli and Bjorn enter the duelling ring. Then Gisli said that Bjorn should swing first. "No one has ever offered that to me," says Bjorn, "but then no one but you has ever challenged me to a duel."

Now Bjorn brandishes his sword toward Gisli, but Gisli comes with his shield in front him. And Bjorn swings his sword and it sliced off everything above the handle of the shield. Gisli swings back against Bjorn and the sword meets the bottom point of Bjorn's shield,[^2] and it slices off his leg below the knee. Gisli swings his sword at Bjorn one more time onto his head. When they turned toward Bjorn's band, some of them were killed and some of them ran into a forest.

[^2]: The shape of this shield appears to be of the kind in which the bottom portion of the shield ends in a point. The "shield tail" is the bottom taper below Bjorn's knee.

<!--
fyrir utan = accross or beyond
mundritha=handle of the shield.

skjaldr-sporthr=The shield tail. The lower part of an oblong shield.

And so Gisli went home after these events and he got a good reputation from them. After that he takes control of the farm after the legacy of his brother Ari, who previously owned it. He also married Ingibjorg--some time passes--but he didn't let the sword leave his possession because Kol did not ask for its return. 

One day they meet each other outside. Gisli had in his hand the sword Grasida and Kol had and ax. Kol asked, "How did the sword work for you?" Gisli expressed his approval of the sword's performance. "I now wish to take it back," says Kol, "If you think to have accomplished your need at this time."
<!--

"Will you give it to me?" says Gisli. 

"No," says Kol.

"I will give you your freedom and a shipload of provisions so that you can travel abroad along with other men as you wish," says Gisli. 

"I will not give you the sword," says Kol. 

"Then I will give you your freedom and lend to you or give to you land. And along with this wealth I will give to you as much livestock as you desire to have."

"But I would rather not give you the sword," says Kol.

"You are too stubborn about this," says Gisli. "Set your price to however much moveable wealth you might have in mind," he says. "I will not be stingy with payment if you settle on any amount. Along with this I will get for you your freedom and an honorable marriage, if that is what you desire."

"There is nothing to discuss," says Kol. "I will not give you the sword for what you offer. And so now that is happening which I have originally suspected, that it would not be certain whether you would give the sword back, if you knew what might be in the precious thing."

"I will tell you," says Gisli, "how it will go, that neither of us will do well, because I am not inclined to give up the sword, and it will not come into the hands of another man except to me if I have something to say about it."

Kol raised up the ax, but Gisli brandished Grasida, and each swung their weapons at each other. Kol hewed the sword into Gisli's head so that it was lodged in Gisli's brain. And the sword came into Kol's head, but it didn't cut. However, Kol's skull split open and the sword broke in pieces.

Then Kol said, "Now it would have gone better if I had originally taken the sword as I asked. And so all this will be unravelled in misfortune, in which your family will inherit."
<!--
This is unsatisfying. Revisit the dependent clause.

And then each of them gave up their lives.

After that Ingibjorg longs to leave Surnadal, and she goes home to her father with her wealth. Thorbjorn acquires a good marriage. He travels east across the Kjölen mountains to Frey's Islands. He proposed to a certain woman called Isgerd, and he married her. AFter that he went home to Surnadal, and took up managing the estate with this father. Thorkel Gullhjalmr lives for a short time from that time before he gets sick and dies. Thorbjorn inherits all of his father's wealth. After that he was known as Thorbjorn Sur. Thorbjorn and Isgerd had children and they are so named. Their son is named Thorkel, the oldest, and the second Gisli. The third is called Ari, but he immediately goes east to Frey's Islands to be fostered, and so he has little to do with this saga. Their daughter is named Thordis. Thorkel was a large man, beautiful in appearance, powerful in his strength, and more showy in his appearance than most men. Gisli was a swarthy man, and like men who have grown so large, men could hardly estimate his strength.
<!--
*** Got it. See Jómsviking Chp. 16.
-->
He was a skillful man, very hard working, and gentle in his demeanor. Their sister Thordis was beautiful in her appearance and very noble looking, rather hardy in her demeanor, and most haughty.

These men who live in Surnadal are named, one is called Bard and another is called Kolbeinn. They were together as children and they were rather wealthy, but no one was bound to them. 
Furthermore, Kolbeinn and Bard's fathers were absent, due to a voyage to England.
<!--
_litlu_? It feels like it's missing a word here. Review.
-->
That farm, at which Bard lived, was called Hella, and Granaskeið was the name of the place at which Kolbeinn lived.
They were very well-matched in their childhood with the sons of Þorbjorn Sur, and each of them were the most cheerful men.

***

Now in that time a change in in kingship occurred, more than once. First, Eric Bloodaxe, the son of Harald Fairhair, took charge of the kingdom from his father while he lived. When Harald passed away, Hakon came from the west from England and immediately went north to Trondheim when he meets Sigurd Earl of Lade, and he inquired before him whether his father Hakon had been ruling in Trondheim. [^3]

[^3]: Eric Bloodaxe may have been king in both Norway and Northumbria. His father was Harald Fairhair. His successor was Haakon Haraldsson or Haakon the good, or Adalsteinfostre. This makes this Haakon Eric Bloodaxe's  brother. He did indeed succeed Eric to the throne. Make this into a footnote. 

<!-- (??? Also, start heavy proofreading here.) -->

Hakon said to him, "It seems to me also that deal was accomplished well, that you uphold me as king, but I might grant you such honors as your father had--that you might be free, but not enslaved, as all others are in this land."

That had been Harald Fair-hair's burden that he possessed all the land in Norway, both inhabited and uninhabited, and equally so the all seas, lakes, and rivers,and everyone had to be his land-tenants.

Now the earl thinks this over and was happy with Hakon's offer, and then they bound their friendship with each other fast.

Sigurd Earl then issues a summons for an assembly of three districts. [^4]

[^4]: Something something about the process.

When the assembly begins, Hakon stands up before them and says, "It is known to everyone who have come that Harald Fair-hair laid all of Norway under his rule, including everything from the north to Finnmark and eastward to Alvdal. He became the sole ruler over all people. He had many sons who are known to you, and most of them were well-raised, but he loved them unequally. He sent some of his sons away to other lands, but others he kept with him in his court, like Eric Bloodaxe, who he thought was better than all his other sons.
Everyone, look at what he has done while he has been alive.
At this moment, my brother Eric has had very much accomplished those things, which follows great shame.
