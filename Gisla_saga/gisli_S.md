## English translation of the variant introduction from the long version, from AM 149 fol.

It is at the beginning of this saga that Harald Fairhair ruled Norway. He was the first sovereign king over all Norway, and because of him there came to be many exiles to various lands. And there were also powerful men among the exiles because they did not wish to endure his tyranny, yet they didn't have the strength to challenge him. In the days of King Harald, Iceland was discovered and settled. The children of Ketil Flatnose journeyed here. Among them were Bjorn the Easterner, from whom the Kjallakar are descended. And Helgi Bjolan, who settled in Kjalarnes. And Thorunn Hyrna, who married Helgi the Lean in Eyjafjord. From them come the Eyfirthingar. Aud, Ketil's daughter, finally journeyed here, and from her family comes the Earls of Orkney, the Gautuskeggjar in the Faroe Islands, and the Breidfyrthingar here in Island. Thorolf Mostur-beard also journeyed here, and he took all of Thorsness land, and from him the Snorrungar are descended. Ulfr the Squinter journeyed here and he took Reykjanes in Breidafjord, and the Reyknesingar are descended from him. Thord the Viking journeyed here. He came into Dyrafjord and took all the land on the southern side. Hrollaug, the son of Ragnvald the Earl of Maeri, and the brother of Earl Turf-Einar, Thorir the Silent, and Göngu-Hrolf, journeyed here and took land east of Síða, and from him are descended the people of Síða.

In that time there was a powerful hersir in Norway who was named Thorkel, and he was nicknamed Gullhjalmr. He was married in Sunnhordaland in Surnadal, and he had three sons with his wife. The oldest was named Ari, another of his sons was Gisli, and the third was Thorbjorn. They were all promising men. The name of the man who ruled over Fjardafylki is Isi. His daughter is named Ingibjorg. Ari Thorkelsson asked for her hand in marriage, and so she was given to him. From her he acquired much wealth. One man named Kol accompanied her. He came from a prominent family, but he was abducted and so he was considered a slave. He travelled with Ingibjorg to Surnadal. Thorkel gives a rich farmstead to this son Ari, and he takes control of the farm there in the valley. He appears to be a most promising man.

That man is named in the saga who is called Bjorn. He was called Bjorn the Black. He was a berserker and a great dueller. There were also twelve others who accompanied him. Bjorn was skilled in magic, and so instruments of iron never cut him. He was unpopular with everyone. He settled himself into the house of the men who appealed to him. Furthermore he lay in bed with their wives and daughters, and did for himself whatever suited him at such a time. Everyone was anxious when he came, and they rejoiced when he left.

It is told that Bjorn learned that Ari brought a beautiful woman to his farmstead and that he received an easy inheritance. He considers it advantageous to go to that place. He turns in that direction with his gang and arrives there one day in the evening. Ari and Bjorn, along with the other Berserkers, meet each other. Bjorn says that he intends to take management of the farmstead for himself, and that he intends to have his wife Ingibjorg in the same bed as he. After such a time that he saw fit, Bjorn asked Ari to do whatever he thought better, to go away or stay there. Ari declares that that he will not leave and that he did not plan for him to have any control over the farmstead. 

"Very good!" Bjorn says, "but there is another choice. I will challenge you to a duel if you agree to a delay of three days. In that time, each of us will try to take Ingibjorg, and he who takes victory in the duel shall also take wealth from the other. I will not surrender any wealth in this duel, indeed I always take wealth from my opponent."

Ari says that he will eagerly fight. The Berserkers departed at this time, and they then prepared for the duel. They come now onto the duelling site, and their dealings conclude in that Ari is killed. Yet the berserker receives no wounds because the iron did not bite. Now Bjorn considers himself to have won the land, the moveable property, and the wife. He makes it known publicly that he plans to go to that farm that Ari used to own that same evening.

Ari's brother Gisli answers soon after all this happened.
<!--Revisit this. I'm not convinced I got it.-->
"If this horrible thing comes to pass, misery will overcome us all. Now this can never happen. I will challenge you to a duel first thing in the morning. I would much rather die in a duel than endure this calamity."

Bjorn says, "That is good! You will put an end to your entire family if you intend to risk doing battle with me."<!--fara=put an end? Revisit this too.-->

After this they parted and Gisli goes home to the farm that Ari had. The news about the duel got around, as did the passing of Ari, and everyone thought that ownership of the estate was lost. Gisli goes to meet wtih Ingibjorg and tells her about the passing of Ari, that he challenged Bjorn to a duel, and that they must fight tomorrow.

"That is a miserable plan," says Ingibjorg, "and I fear that to you will not do well unless you make use of the help of others." 

Gisli says, "I will ask you, or anyone else, for help. If it is most likely that whatever you propose will contribute to my cause, then victory might be more likely than it would otherwise."

"There is a certain man," says Ingibjorg, "who appears most likely to know how to contribute to this case in a way that the advantage might come to you."

"Who is that?," says Gisli.

"Kol, my fosterling is he," she says, "I believe that he might have a certain sword, which shall be better than any other. However he makes it out to be without worth, and he calls it his hacking blade."

And now Kol was sent for and he comes to meet Gisli and Ingibjorn. Gisli said, "You have a rather good sword."

Kol replies, "My sword is a small treasure, however there are many things in a churl's house that is not in a king's stronghold."

Gisli said, "Will you not loan me the sword for the duel against Bjorn?"

Kol spoke,
"Now you will act like so many people when someone possesses a valuable thing and the owner cannot bear to give it away.
But I will tell you now, that the sword will cut anything it strikes, whether it is made of iron or anything else. It cannot be dulled because it is forged by dwarves. The sword is named Grasida (Grey-blade).
And you must expect that I will be displeased if I cannot take the sword when I wish to hold it."

"On the other hand it is not right," says Gisli, "that you hold onto your sword while I have had such dire need for it."

So now Gisli takes the sword and night passes. Before they leave home for the duel, Thorbjorn asks his brother Gisli, "Brother, who among us should fight the berserker today, and who should slaughter the calf?"

Gisli answers, "I recommend that you slaughter the calf, then Bjorn and I will do battle."[^1]

[^1]: According to some sources, the Holmgang ritual included an animal sacrifice.

He did not make the easy choice. They go went then to the dueling site. Gisli and Bjorn enter the duelling ring. Then Gisli said that Bjorn should swing first. "No one has ever offered that to me," says Bjorn, "but no one but you has ever challenged me to a duel."

Now Bjorn swings his sword against Gisli, but his shield comes before Gisli, and
