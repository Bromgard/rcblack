# Saga of Gisli Sursson

## English translation of the variant introduction from the long version, from AM 149 fol. 

## 1

It is at the beginning of this saga that Harald Fairhair ruled Norway. He was the first sovereign king over all Norway, and because of him there came to be many exiles to various lands. And there were also powerful men among the exiles because they did not wish to endure his tyranny, yet they didn't have the strength to challenge him. In the days of King Harald, Iceland was discovered and settled. The children of Ketil Flatnose journeyed here. Among them were Bjorn the Easterner, from whom the Kjallakar are descended. And Helgi Bjolan, who settled in Kjalarnes. And Thorunn Hyrna, who married Helgi the Lean in Eyjafjord. From them come the Eyfirthingar. Aud, Ketil's daughter, finally journeyed here, and from her family comes the Earls of Orkney, the Gautuskeggjar in the Faroe Islands, and the Breidfyrthingar here in Iceland. Thorolf Mostur-beard also journeyed here, and he took all of Thorsness land, and from him the Snorrungar are descended. Ulfr the Squinter journeyed here and he took Reykjanes in Breidafjord, and the Reyknesingar are descended from him. Thord the Viking journeyed here. He came into Dyrafjord and took all the land on the southern side. Hrollaug, the son of Ragnvald the Earl of Maeri, and the brother of Earl Turf-Einar, Thorir the Silent, and Göngu-Hrolf, journeyed here and took land east of Síða, and from him are descended the people of Síða.

In that time there was a powerful hersir in Norway who was named Thorkel, and he was nicknamed Gullhjalmr. He was married in Sunnhordaland in Surnadal, and he had three sons with his wife. The oldest was named Ari, another of his sons was Gisli, and the third was Thorbjorn. They were all promising men. The name of the man who ruled over Fjardafylki is Isi. His daughter is named Ingibjorg. Ari Thorkelsson asked for her hand in marriage, and so she was given to him. From her he acquired much wealth. One man named Kol accompanied her. He came from a prominent family, but he was abducted and so he was considered a slave. He travelled with Ingibjorg to Surnadal. Thorkel gives a rich farmstead to this son Ari, and he takes control of the farm there in the valley. He appears to be a most promising man.

That man is named in the saga who is called Bjorn. He was called Bjorn the Black. He was a berserker and a great dueller. There were also twelve others who accompanied him. Bjorn was skilled in magic, and so instruments of iron never cut him. He was unpopular with everyone. He settled himself into the house of the men who appealed to him. Furthermore he lay in bed with their wives and daughters, and did for himself whatever suited him at such a time. Everyone was anxious when he came, and they rejoiced when he left.

It is told that Bjorn learned that Ari brought a beautiful woman to his farmstead and that he received an easy inheritance. He considers it advantageous to go to that place. He turns in that direction with his gang and arrives there one day in the evening. Ari and Bjorn, along with the other Berserkers, meet each other. Bjorn says that he intends to take management of the farmstead for himself, and that he intends to have his wife Ingibjorg in the same bed as he. After such a time that he saw fit, Bjorn asked Ari to do whatever he thought better, to go away or stay there. Ari declares that that he will not leave and that he did not plan for him to have any control over the farmstead. 

"Very good!" Bjorn says, "but there is another choice. I will challenge you to a duel if you agree to a delay of three days. In that time, each of us will try to take Ingibjorg, and he who takes victory in the duel shall also take wealth from the other. I will not surrender any wealth in this duel, indeed I always take wealth from my opponent."

Ari says that he will eagerly fight. The Berserkers departed at this time, and they then prepared for the duel. They come now onto the duelling site, and their dealings conclude in that Ari is killed. Yet the berserker receives no wounds because the iron did not bite. Now Bjorn considers himself to have won the land, the moveable property, and the wife. He makes it known publicly that he plans to go to that farm that Ari used to own that same evening.

Ari's brother Gisli answers soon after all this happened.
<!--Revisit this. I'm not convinced I got it.-->
"If this horrible thing comes to pass, misery will overcome us all. Now this can never happen. I will challenge you to a duel first thing in the morning. I would much rather die in a duel than endure this calamity."

Bjorn says, "That is good! You will put an end to your entire family if you intend to risk doing battle with me."<!--fara=put an end? Revisit this too.-->

After this they parted and Gisli goes home to the farm that Ari had. The news about the duel got around, as did the passing of Ari, and everyone thought that ownership of the estate was lost. Gisli goes to meet wtih Ingibjorg and tells her about the passing of Ari, that he challenged Bjorn to a duel, and that they must fight tomorrow.

"That is a miserable plan," says Ingibjorg, "and I fear that to you will not do well unless you make use of the help of others." 

Gisli says, "I will ask you, or anyone else, for help. If it is most likely that whatever you propose will contribute to my cause, then victory might be more likely than it would otherwise."

"There is a certain man," says Ingibjorg, "who appears most likely to know how to contribute to this case in a way that the advantage might come to you."

"Who is that?," says Gisli.

"Kol, my fosterling is he," she says, "I believe that he might have a certain sword, which shall be better than any other. However he makes it out to be without worth, and he calls it his hacking blade."

And now Kol was sent for and he comes to meet Gisli and Ingibjorn. Gisli said, "You have a rather good sword."

Kol replies, "My sword is a small treasure, however there are many things in a churl's house that is not in a king's stronghold."

Gisli said, "Will you not loan me the sword for the duel against Bjorn?"

Kol spoke,
"Now you will act like so many people when someone possesses a valuable thing and the owner cannot bear to give it away.
But I will tell you now, that the sword will cut anything it strikes, whether it is made of iron or anything else. It cannot be dulled because it is forged by dwarves. The sword is named Grasida (Grey-blade).
And you must expect that I will be displeased if I cannot take the sword when I wish to hold it."

"On the other hand it is not right," says Gisli, "that you hold onto your sword while I have had such dire need for it."

So now Gisli takes the sword and night passes. Before they leave home for the duel, Thorbjorn asks his brother Gisli, "Brother, who among us should fight the berserker today, and who should slaughter the calf?"

Gisli answers, "I recommend that you slaughter the calf, then Bjorn and I will do battle."[^1]

[^1]: According to some sources, the Holmgang ritual included an animal sacrifice.

He did not make the easy choice. They go went then to the dueling site. Gisli and Bjorn enter the duelling ring. Then Gisli said that Bjorn should swing first. "No one has ever offered that to me," says Bjorn, "but then no one but you has ever challenged me to a duel."

Now Bjorn brandishes his sword toward Gisli, but Gisli comes with his shield in front him. And Bjorn swings his sword and it sliced off everything above the handle of the shield. Gisli swings back against Bjorn and the sword meets the bottom point of Bjorn's shield,[^2] and it slices off his leg below the knee. Gisli swings his sword at Bjorn one more time onto his head. When they turned toward Bjorn's band, some of them were killed and some of them ran into a forest.

[^2]: The shape of this shield appears to be of the kind in which the bottom portion of the shield ends in a point. The "shield tail" is the bottom taper below Bjorn's knee.

<!--
fyrir utan = accross or beyond
mundritha=handle of the shield.

skjaldr-sporthr=The shield tail. The lower part of an oblong shield.
-->

And so Gisli went home after these events and he got a good reputation from them. After that he takes control of the farm after the legacy of his brother Ari, who previously owned it. He also married Ingibjorg--some time passes--but he didn't let the sword leave his possession because Kol did not ask for its return. 

One day they meet each other outside. Gisli had in his hand the sword Grasida and Kol had and ax. Kol asked, "How did the sword work for you?" Gisli expressed his approval of the sword's performance. "I now wish to take it back," says Kol, "If you think to have accomplished your need at this time."
<!--
I'm not sure I'm quite here yet. Revisit.

"Will you give it to me?" says Gisli. 

"No," says Kol.

"I will give you your freedom and a shipload of provisions so that you can travel abroad along with other men as you wish," says Gisli. 

"I will not give you the sword," says Kol. 

"Then I will give you your freedom and lend to you or give to you land. And along with this wealth I will give to you as much livestock as you desire to have."

"But I would rather not give you the sword," says Kol.

"You are too stubborn about this," says Gisli. "Set your price to however much moveable wealth you might have in mind," he says. "I will not be stingy with payment if you settle on any amount. Along with this I will get for you your freedom and an honorable marriage, if that is what you desire."

"There is nothing to discuss," says Kol. "I will not give you the sword for what you offer. And so now that is happening which I have originally suspected, that it would not be certain whether you would give the sword back, if you knew what might be in the precious thing."

"I will tell you," says Gisli, "how it will go, that neither of us will do well, because I am not inclined to give up the sword, and it will not come into the hands of another man except to me if I have something to say about it."

Kol raised up the ax, but Gisli brandished Grasida, and each swung their weapons at each other. Kol hewed the sword into Gisli's head so that it was lodged in Gisli's brain. And the sword came into Kol's head, but it didn't cut. However, Kol's skull split open and the sword broke in pieces.

Then Kol said, "Now it would have gone better if I had originally taken the sword as I asked. And so all this will be unravelled in misfortune, in which your family will inherit."
<!--
This is unsatisfying. Revisit the dependent clause.

And then each of them gave up their lives.

After that Ingibjorg longs to leave Surnadal, and she goes home to her father with her wealth. Thorbjorn acquires a good marriage. He travels east across the Kjölen mountains to Frey's Islands. He proposed to a certain woman called Isgerd, and he married her. After that he went home to Surnadal, and took up managing the estate with this father. Thorkel Gullhjalmr lives for a short time from that time before he gets sick and dies. Thorbjorn inherits all of his father's wealth. After that he was known as Thorbjorn Sur. Thorbjorn and Isgerd had children and they are so named. Their son is named Thorkel, the oldest, and the second Gisli. The third is called Ari, but he immediately goes east to Frey's Islands to be fostered, and so he has little to do with this saga. Their daughter is named Thordis. Thorkel was a large man, beautiful in appearance, powerful in his strength, and more showy in his appearance than most men. Gisli was a swarthy man, and like men who have grown so large, men could hardly estimate his strength.
<!--
*** Got it. See Jómsviking Chp. 16.
-->
He was a skillful man, very hard working, and gentle in his demeanor. Their sister Thordis was beautiful in her appearance and very noble looking, rather hardy in her demeanor, and most haughty.

These men who live in Surnadal are named, one is called Bard and another is called Kolbeinn. They were together as children and they were rather wealthy, but no one was bound to them. 
Furthermore, Kolbeinn and Bard's fathers were absent, due to a voyage to England.
<!--
_litlu_? It feels like it's missing a word here. Review.
-->
That farm, at which Bard lived, was called Hella, and Granaskeið was the name of the place at which Kolbeinn lived.
They were very well-matched in their childhood with the sons of Þorbjorn Sur, and each of them were the most cheerful men.

***

Now in that time a change in in kingship occurred, more than once. First, Eric Bloodaxe, the son of Harald Fairhair, took charge of the kingdom from his father while he lived. When Harald passed away, Hakon came from the west from England and immediately went north to Trondheim when he meets Sigurd Earl of Lade, and he inquired before him whether his father Hakon had been ruling in Trondheim. [^3]

[^3]: Eric Bloodaxe may have been king in both Norway and Northumbria. His father was Harald Fairhair. His successor was Haakon Haraldsson or Haakon the good, or Adalsteinfostre. This makes this Haakon Eric Bloodaxe's  brother. He did indeed succeed Eric to the throne. Make this into a footnote. 

<!-- (??? Also, start heavy proofreading here.) -->

Hakon said to him, "It seems to me also that deal was accomplished well, that you uphold me as king, but I might grant you such honors as your father had--that you might be free, but not enslaved, as all others are in this land."

That had been Harald Fair-hair's burden that he possessed all the land in Norway, both inhabited and uninhabited, and equally so the all seas, lakes, and rivers,and everyone had to be his land-tenants.

Now the earl thinks this over and was happy with Hakon's offer, and then they bound their friendship with each other fast.

Sigurd Earl then issues a summons for an assembly of three districts. [^4]

[^4]: Something something about the process.

When the assembly begins, Hakon stands up before them and says, "It is known to everyone who have come that Harald Fair-hair laid all of Norway under his rule, including everything from the north to Finnmark and eastward to Alvdal. He became the sole ruler over all people. He had many sons who are known to you, and most of them were well-raised, but he loved them unequally. He sent some of his sons away to other lands, but others he kept with him in his court, like Eric Bloodaxe, who he thought was better than all his other sons.
Everyone, look at what he has done while he has been alive.
By now my brother Eric has accomplished very many things that resulted in much misery.

So now I intend to ask you, residents of Trondheim, that you think about what would strengthen and steady the ship of state. You may either choose what would be more advantageous to the tenantry, and also your kin, and make all the people become more prosperous.

I will also proclaim that I will return all your inherited lands to every man who will turn to me and call me king."

Many men spoke among each other, "What a wondrous sight! King Harald Fairhair is here, and he has become young again! He was old when we last saw him! But how can this be? Either he must have some son that looks so much like him, that no one can discern him from his father. Or that one is young, and the other is old, and one of them just gave us back our inheritance and our family estates, and his father, through tyranny, deprived us of these things."

So, then all the common people said that they would prefer that man who looked most like King Harald as their king, who demonstrated good will and kindness, that man who settled there from abroad with his kin.  But would never elect to have Eirik rule over them, nor would they have Queen Gunnhild or her sons.  

The Thing concluded When Hakon was received as king by the people. And when the news of who the Trondheim assembly chose as their king travelled to one district, and then another, men sent a message to Hakon and requested that they celebrate the Eucharist with him. And when Hakon became king, this was the same time that Þorbjorn surr and his sons migrated to Surnadal. 

***

Now it is to be said first that Kolbeinn, thought it most pleasant to speak with Thordis, Thorbjorn surr's daughter. So Kolbeinn courted her when he came to visit Thorbjorn. It did not take very much time before word of this got around. And so when her father Thorbjorn learned about this, he figured that it must certainly be true.
He then speaks with his sons, because it seemed to him that they would remedy this situation.  

Gisli said that it is possible to remedy this so long as there is no violence. 

"But don't you say that which you think is enmity when we speak?" fix

"I see," said Thorbjorn, "that much more has appeared out of thin air, that must yet be struck down. Now it appears to me to me that it is much more likely that you two brothers shall become dishonest--and so there shall be little manliness among either of you."

Gisli said, "Do not cause any grief over his visit, father! But I shall advise him to give up coming here."

"About this, your are most likely than not," says Thorbjorn," to take your message to him, that he that he stop coming here and grant you gratitude and thanks, and cease his wretched behavior, though your words will go ignored."

Now this father and son ended their conversation and Gisli leaves him. The next time Kolbeinn came to that place, Gisli leads him upon the path that evening, where he went away, and Gisli tells him that he no longer wishes him to come there, "because my father is bothered by your behavior. People are talking among themselves that you are seducing my sister Thordis, without my father's consent. I will manage this for you if you wish to do as I say happily and as a good sport."

Kolbeinn said, "What good will that do if you know that nothing will happen? I don't know what would be more difficult for me, the sadness of your father or his happiness.

Gisli answers, ... 

Nothing is thither to take upon.

Here will also so happen as you say, that I will esteem that most in the struggle, as is the wish of my father. 

Now it would appear to me very important that you do what I say now, and then try once again later. But I fear that we will dislike each other more if you wish to remain stubborn."

Kolbeinn receives his words with coldness they they part with that. Gisli goes home and nothing more happens. Kolbeinn came by less often, but yet he still came.???
He things to himself he was yet sad --downcast-- at home, and so he goes to Thorbjorn.
And one day, when he was there, Gisli sat in the sitting room working on something, and his father and brothers were all there. Thorkel was most cheerful with Kolbeinn, and three of them, Thordis, Thorkel, and Kolbein sat on the high floor of the hall together. When the day wore on and evening came, they stood up and left. Thorbjorn and Gisli remained on the high floor. Then Thorbjorn took to speech, "your persistent requests [to Kolbeinn] will come to nothing.

***

Not only has your way of doing things become girly, but I don't know, you brothers, whether or not I should consider you my sons or my daughters.

***

Gisli replies, "Do not be so 

***

Now Gisli could bear to hear his father's foul language and stepped forward. Thorkel and Kolbeinn went out through the door, but Thordis want back toward the high floor (dais?). Gisli goes out after them, and they walk altogether. Gisli nevertheless broached the topic and asked that he stop coming. Kolbeinn proclaimed that he does not plan that this will happen. Gisli said, "you have little regard for my words. Then our fellowship will make a turn for the worse, but I expected that."

"I don't think I caused that," says Kolbeinn.

Gisli said, "Either it shall be, that you shall respect my word or else I will declare that this friendship which we have between to be at an end."

"You must decide what you wish to do," says Kolbeinn, "but I do not feel any less inclined to stop coming to visit."

Gisli drew his sword and swung it at him, and the strike accomplished its goal completely. Thorkell became very offended by this deed, but Gisli goes back inside. Thorbjorn hears how Gisli's persistence played out. "I will say," says Gisli, "that it had gone well, because we discussed, when we parted, that Kolbeinn shall stop coming to visit, so that you will no longer grieve." 
<!--
"...so that you no longer grieve." You need to look this over carefully. I'm really not sure of what's going on here syntactically.
-->

"Your words mean the same," says Thorbjorn, "if he is dead." 

"Consider it all for the better," said Gisli, "that your wish in this matter has been done."

"Now be proud and content of your handiwork," says Thorbjorn, "and so it is that I do not have a daughter for a child."

Now it is spoken in this saga about Thorkel, that he didn't want to go home and so he plans to move east to Freyseyjar. When he goes to the king's landlord who was named Sirgurd. He was not a rich man and was full of good-will among all the people. He kindly received Thorkel and asked how things are going with his father. Thorkel says that he plans to go to Kjol. "That is the one journey," said Sigurd, "that I wish you do not put your mind to, because it presents many difficulties." 

"What bears most of this, says Thorkel. (What does this matter?)

"I grant that it not wise," says Sigurd, "but I will tell this to you truly. Of all those who travel in a group of fewer than twelve, no one came back. But those who travel in a large group were not aware of any difficulty in their passage."

"It appears to me uncertain what the cause of this might be," says Thorkel. "But I cannot stop my journey and go back for this reason. This I will...

(A lacuna of ten leaves from the MS begins here)

...Gisli and the party (?) then take the timber and load it onto the ship, however they incur wounds from the recent events. The vikings then wish to set off, but they could not hold their ships. Some of them jumped into other ships, but some dove into the water. And those ships that were tied fast were stripped and disabled. Other ships that were captured from this battle were taken. After this the remaining vikings fled. And then Gisli and his party took much wealth and stripped and disabled the ships. After this they land in Surnadal. They were home for a while and they knew that their influence grew from this journey.

That same year the brothers Einar and Sigurd made the journey north to Fludenesi with nearly forty men. They travelled until they arrived in Surnadal in the night. They came first upon Hella to meet Bard and they came into the house, and they gave him to choices: Either he will have his life taken, or she shall come alone on their journey with them, alongside those chaps who are right here. Bard proclaimed that he was unrelated (or had no concern with) to Thorbjorn and his sons. "By all means I think I value life more," he says. After this he joined them on the journey along with ten men. They come unawares to Thorbjorn in Stokka. He sent some of this followers into the shed and some of them to the stock-chamber (footnote here, I guess). Gisli built the stock-chamber some winters earlier, and made it as was his custom, that he cut every log in the entire wall, and it was without a middle piece (support piece?), and they were out of their fastenings (ropes), but 
<!--
Specific carpentry language. Double back here.
-->
The weather was blustery and the wind was sharp, and blew against the stock-chamber. They drag wood both around the out the shed and the stock-chamber and struck a fire. When those int he stock-chamber became aware of the fire, they lock up the door. There was a vat of soured whey in the shed. They take the soured whey and extinguished the fire. Now they build a great fire another time both ways from the door, and the fire immediately catches the wood. The father and his sons were all inside the stock-chamber, and so was the women, Isgerd and Thordis. Gisli walked away from the door went toward the gable end of the building. He pulled the cross-beam and pushed out some of the timber. After this they goes out, followed by everyone else, one by one. There was no one outside nearby, since they were all guarding the door, so that no one could come out. But this didn't work.
<!--
This last sentence is fuzzy. Reread.
-->
They followed the smoke away from the farm until they came to the forest. When they came to the forest they saw homeward, that the shed and the farm is burning. Then Gisli said:

>
>The poem
>will
>be placed
>here

Now they are in the forest, and the farm smolders with cool coals. The brothers (name them) did not leave earlier, for they thought that Thorbjorn, his sons, and everyone else burned inside. Overall, it was thirty people who had burned in the hall. The brothers said wherever they are, the brothers and their father certainly dead.
<!--
This one is weird and super idiomatic.
-->
Gisli and the others stayed hidden until the brothers and their people left.
The secretly strengthened (increased) their following before they went to Bard during the night and lit the farm on fire, and burned everything including all the people who were inside. They went home and made arrangements for farm-building. Gisli disappeared and no one knew what became of him. When spring came, he returned home. Immediately after he returned he secretly sold their estate, and the valuables were carried away. That was indeed the intent of those brothers, that they move themselves away from Norway. Gisli had disappeared so that he occupied himself with the construction of their ship. And that so happened that they planned their move in silence altogether. That improvement in their lives (Nom.) would not be heard of until they were aboard the ships. On those ships were thirty men, and yet more women. After this they steered the ship into the sea, and they docked at the shore of some islands, and they planned thence to wait for a fair wind. One a day with good weather, the brothers and their men boarded the boats. 
And ten were in the merchant ship, and ten sons were on each boat. 
<!--
clearly some weird math here. Review. 
-->
Thorbjorn was in a ship in the rear. Gisla and his men rowed northward to land and made for Fluduness. Gisli says that he wishes to meet those brothers, before he journeys from Norway. And when they come there, they learn that the brothers were collecting King Hakon's land-rent. Gisli turned toward where they were going and blocked their way. The brother's cohort was fifteen men altogether. They clashed and a harsh battle begun. Einar and Sigurd fell and all of their companions. Gisli killed five men and Thorkel killed three. Gisli says that he has errands to run at the farm. Gisli goes home to the farm and into the hall and looks for where Skeggi lies. He turns to him and hews his head off with his sword.
They plunder everything there, and they were most manfully with everything they did.
<!--
fix, of course
-->
They also took all the livestock and moveable wealth as they could get. They then rowed to their ships and then go up to the island and made a solemn (great) vow to call upon the beginning of their journey. A fair wind comes and they set sail for Iceland. They have a long voyage before them, and difficult. They said to the northern part of Iceland, and then farther to the West Fjords. Their ship arrived in Dyrafjord, in the Haukadalsa river. They got off the ships and set their tents. News of the arrival of the ships got around. 

A man is named Thorkel. He lived in Alvidra. He was a wealthy man, and noble born. In Keldudal lived another man who is named Thorkel, who was Eiriks son. Each were settled on opposite ends of the West Fjords. Thorkel Eiriksson sold Thorbjorn and their party land in Haukadal. That man named Thorgrim Nef already lived up the river. Farther up the valley lived one man who was also named Thorkel, who was called Anmarki. He was married, and his wife is named Thorhalla. She was the sister of Thorgrim's nephew. Thorkel Anmarki took after his namesake. But Thorhalla couldn't make up for her husband's disabilities.
<!--
note, I guess
-->
They had a son named Thorstein. He was big and strong. In Medaldal in from the river Haukadal, lives the man who is named Onundr. He was quite wealthy and an honest man. Thorbjorn, Gisli, and Thorkel set up their estate at this time. 

There is a man named Bjartmar. He came out to Iceland to Anarfjord and set up his farm which is called Eyju, which is in Arnarfjardarbotni. Bjartmar was a married man. His sons were named Helgi and Sigurd. Bjartmars daughter was named Gunnhild. She was beautiful in appearance. In the summertime after a ship came from the sea. The man who had the ship is named Vesteinn. He went to take his daughter Gunnhild in marriage. Of all men, Vesteinn was most skilled at handling weapons. Gunnhild and Vestainn had two children. Their son is named Vesteinn and their daughter Aud. Vesteinn Vesteinsson was a good sea-faring man, but he nevertheless had a farm in Onundarfjord next to Mount Hesti. His wife is named Hild. His sons are named Berg and Helgi. After these events passed, Thorbjorn Surr and his wife Isgerd died. Thorkel and Gisli took control over the farm after them. Thorbjorn and Isgerd were laid in a mound in Haukadal. Soon after this Thorkell got married. 

## Chapter 5

A man is named Thorbjorn and he was also called Selagnup. He lived in Talknafjord at Kvigandafell. His wife is named Thordis and their daughter is named Asgerd. Thorkel Sursson proposed and he took her for his wife. His brother Gisli proposed to Aud, Vesteinn's sister, and he took her for his wife. They lived together in Haukadal. Although they were married, they didn't divide the wealth between them. One spring, it is said, that the Thorkel in Alvidra took a journey south to the Thorsness Thing, and the Surssons, Gisli and Thorkel went along. Thorstein Cod-biter, the son of Thorolf Moster-beard, lived in Thorsness. Thorstein's first son is named Thorgrim, and the other son is named Bork the Thick. His daughter is named Thordis. Thorstein's wife is called Thora, the daughter of Olaf Feilan, the son of Thord Bellower. Thorkel concluded his cases at the thing. Thorstein Cod-biter invited Thorkel and the Surssons to his home, and he gave them good gifts. Before they parted the Surssons invited Thorstein's sons west to the thing in Dyrfjord the next spring.

The next six months passed and during this time there was nothing to report. The next spring came, and the Thorsson's arrived, Thorgrim and Bork, along with sixteen men altogether. They then come west to the Valseyarthing, and they meet the Surssons and they invited them to come to their home after the thing. They had already visited Thorkel in Alvidra. They then go home with the Surssons and had a feast in their honor. Thorgrim thought to himself that Thordis, the sister of the two brothers, was beautiful, and brought up his intent, and asked for her hand in marriage. AFter the she was married to Thorgrim and the marriage was immediately set. She followed him home to Saebol where those brothers had already settled a farm.

And Gisli and Thorkel went to Hol and they set up their household. Thorgrim journeyed away to the west and he settled in Saebol. And Bork, his brother, moved to Thorsnes when their father Thorstein died. His nephews, Saka-steinn and Thorod were with him. 

Now all the in-lawed lived tint he same neighborhood in Haukadal, and there was good friendship between them. Thorkel and Gisli build their house in Hol well, so that there is not a less noble house in Saebol. They shared the same fence, and their is friendship is good, at present.
<!--
So far...?
-->
Thorgrim had a godord, which granted both brothers much influence.

Now in the spring the brothers go to the spring assembly along with forty men, and they were all dressed in dyed clothes.

In light of new information, a note.

In this band, there was Veistein, Gisla's brother in law, and those who lived in Surnadal.

## Chapter 6

Gest Oddlieffson was there [at the thing], and he was in a booth with Thorkel the Wealthy from Alvidra. They sit drinking with the Haukdalers, while others were at deliberations, because it was an assembly for lawsuits. Then a great gas-bag named Arnor comes into the Haukdal booth, and said, "You are so high and mighty, you Haukdaler who do nothing but drink. You do not go to the hearings while your thingmen have cases that are to be deliberated. Everyone thinks this, yet I am the only one to speak up."

Then Gisli spoke, "We will go to the hearings right away. It can be, that everyone is saying this."

So now they go to the hearings and Thorgrim asks if anyone needs their support, "and there will be nothing left to be done that we can do for our men, and we shall not hold back as long as we are standing."

Then Thorkel the Wealthy said, "These cases that we are deliberating on now, are unimportant. But we will tell you right away if we need your support."

Now people began to talk about this band of men, about how splendid they looked. They also talk about Thorgrim's speech, and about his nobility.[^5] and when men came back to their booths, Thorkel spoke with Gest the Wise, "How long do you expect their youthful zeal and arrogance be so great?"

[^5]: This looks like a transcription error. In the older redaction all these qualities were attributed to Gisli's band.

Gest answered, "None of them will be of the same mind as they are now after three [years].

But Arnor was close to this conversation and he immediately ran into the Haukdaler's booth and reported those words that Gest had said. Gisli answers, "These words are certainly true, and let's make certain that this doesn't happen. But Gest is an accurate foreseer when it comes to many things, but I see a way that that we can make sure."

"What is that?" says Thorgrim. 

"We should establish with even more certainty than there was before--we must swear to each other in blood brothership," said Gisli. This seemed to each of them to be good advice. They left their booth and went up to the Island's highest point. They raised up a thin and long piece of turf so that both ends were still attached to the ground, and they set a spear with a magical stave marked upon it so that one could take the neck of the spear by the hand. Now all of them had to walk under it, Thorgrim, Gisli, Thorkel, and Vestein. And then they drew their blood and let their gore run together into the earth. The turf arch was raised in the middle, and there the blood and the earth was all mixed together. And then they all fell to their knees, and they swore that each of them would avenge the other as if they were brothers, and they called all the gods to be their witness.

And when it was time for them to take each others hand, Thorgrim said, "I have entered into enough agreements, if I have to do this with Thorkel and my kin Gisli, but I shall not bind myself with too many obligations with Veisteinn." And then he quickly pulled back his hand. It seemed to many that Gest's prediction had much accuracy.

Then Gisli spoke to Thorkel, "I had a bad feeling this would happen, and so something will come of this." And so everyone returned home from the thing, and things settled down with nothing new to report.

## Chapter 7

A ship arrives from over the sea in Dyrafjord that summer, which was owned by two Norwegian brothers. One is Thorir, and the other is Thorarin, and they were from Vik, in Norway. It so happened that Thorgrim rides to the ship and he bought from the two captains four hundred logs, and he have them some of the payment with money he had in hand, and some of of the payment was to be paid later. The easterners docked their ship in Sandaos and they took for themselves a place to stay.

A man is named Odd and he was Orlygs son. He lived in Eyri in Skutilsfjord. He loged with both of the Norwegians. Now Thorgrim sends his son Thorodd to carry the lumber in, and he asked him to count and find out what he was taking. It appeared to him that the lumber they bought was of a different quality than what Thorgrim had described to him. Now the easterners did not wish to keep the bargain they already agreed to, and Thorodd shoke harshly to them. They could not stand this and so they wounded him, and killed him on the spot.

After that, the easterners travelled away from the ship, and they took for themselves horses, and they planned to stay in Skutilsfjord. They travelled the entire day and into the night until they arrived in that valley which leads away from Skutilsfjord. They had their breakfast and continued on their way. Thorgrim learned of these events, that his son was killed for his refusal to pay for the timber. He set out from home and had himself ferried accross the fjord. He goes after the Easterners alone, and comes to the resting place where they are sleeping. He wakes Thorarin by poking him with his spear shaft. He jumps up and tries to grab his sword because he recognized him, but Thorgrim thrusts his spear into him. Now Thorir wakes up and wishes to avenge him, but Thorgrim thrusts lays the spear into him to his death. It is now called Dagverdardal there, in that place where they had breakfast and that place where they died is Austmannafall. Now Thorgrim goes home, and so he becomes famous from this endeavor. He stays at his farm over the winter.

In the spring, Thorgrim and Thorkell fitted the ship that the Easterners had for a journey abroad. They load their property onto the ship and plan to travel far. Those easterners had been very unruly men in Norway and they had no peace there. They took to the sea, and that same summer Gisli and Vestein his in-law went abroad from Skeljavik to Steingrimsfjord. And so each party were both at sea. Onund of Medaldal managed the farm of Gisli and Thorkel, while saka-Steinn, along with Thordis, managed the farm in Saebol. He was Thorgrim's close relative.

In this time, Harald Greycloak ruled over Norway. Thorgrim and Thorkell arrived in the north in Trondheim and they met the king there, greeted him, and he received them well. They made themselves his vassal. They became wealthy and worthy. Gisli and his party were abroad for one hundred days before they sailed aground at Hordaland in the winter, in a tremendous wind, and there was a violent gust in the dead of night. The ship broke to pieces, but the men held onto their provisions.
