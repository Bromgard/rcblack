# Grammatical Cases of Old Icelandic

The Icelandic nouns exhibit four standardized grammatical cases, the _Nominative, Accusative, Dative_, and _Genitive_. Each case is expressed by a distinct suffix or word form that indicates the noun's grammatical function in each sentence.

## The Nominative Case

The nominative case is the noun that represents the subject of the sentence. In English, this noun often appears at the beginning of the sentence and is the verb's agent in a simple sentence.

1) _The viking pets the cat._

In this case, _the Viking_ is the subject of the sentence and the word functions similarly to the Nominative case in inflected languages. In Icelandic the noun adopts a specific word form that indicates this case.

2) _Víkingrinn strýkr kǫtt_.

The grammatical particles for the word, "viking" can be isolated in this way: _Víking(root)+r(case suffix)+inn(definite article)_.The nominative case also appears in a copula construction, a sentence that uses the English connecting verb, _is_.

3) _He is a viking_.

4) _Hann er víkingr_.

## The Accusative case

The accusative case functions as the direct object in a simple English sentence. This is the noun on which the agency of the subject acts. In sentences 1 and 2, the nouns, _cat_ and _kǫtt_ both take the accusative case. We know this because the word form (in this case, the lack of a grammatical suffix), tells us the case. Although the positions of the two nouns are switched in the following sentence, the meaning is the same as sentences 1 and 2.

5) _Kǫtt strýkr Víkingrinn_.

## The Dative case

This is an oblique case that is often governed by prepositions in both English and Icelandic. The dative case is often expressed in English as the indirect object. This construction indicates the noun that is given to a recipient.

6) _The viking gave the monk the cat_.

In this example, _monk_ is in the position that expresses the dative case. To make the functional grammar more explicit, one can reconstruct the sentence with the preposition, _to_.

7) _The viking gave the cat to the monk_.

In Icelandic, the cognate for the word monk communicates the dative case with its appropriate grammatical suffix and definite article.

8) _Víkingrinn gaf Kǫttinn munkinum_.

And likewise the meaning of the following sentence is identical.

9) _Víkingrinn gaf munkinum Kǫttinn_.

Although the word order follows certain conventions, the order can be significantly altered without changing the underlying meaning of the sentence. Skaldic poets make use of this fluid word order in their poetry in the same way antique and medieval Latin poets did.

## Genitive Case

The genitive case grammatical ending is still present in English with the terminal "s" construction that indicates possession. It also likewise appears in possessive construction that utilize the preposition, "of."

10) _The Viking's cat is pretty_.

11) _The cat (of the viking) is pretty_.

12) _Kǫtr vikingsins er fagrlegr_.

13) _Kǫttr víkingsins er fallegr_.

(Sentence 12 is an un-normalized version of 13 and appears as it might in a medieval manuscript.)

### A Note on Prepositions and Case

In addition to these grammatical constructions, prepositions often govern the case of the nouns that follow them. Refer to the chapter on prepositions on page 181. We will also cover this in detail later.
