# Adjectives in Old Icelandic

## Proto-Indo-European Modifiers

The Proto-Indo-European noun was modified by three different conditional constructions:

1) By means of a construction of a coupling (a pattern that would later become many compound nouns) with another noun.

_Stone Roses_, _Mushroomhead_, _Sex Pistols_

2) By means of the genitive case.

_Jane's Addiction, Mary's Danish, Herman's Hermits_

3) The Proto-Indo-European adjective is a familiar part of speech that specifies a specific quality belonging to the accompanying noun. These adjectives had their own system of grammatical declension which may have been inherited from an older system of nominal genitives (or some other grammatical case). In PIE, the adjectives likewise decline to agree with its accompanying noun.

_Green Day, Twisted Sister, Fleet Foxes._

Just as in contemporary speech, there is overlap between these categories. Nouns may easily function as adjectives and vice versa.

Because of this natural overlap, it is possible that before the reconstructed phase of Indo-European development, adjectives and nouns shared the same declensions. However there is evidence in the reconstructed PIE, that the distinction between natural nouns and adjectives, and their declensions were becoming more distinct from each other. In modern Indo-European languages that retain a system of declension, adjectives and nouns as they function grammatically in the grammar bear their own idiomatic systems of declension. The grammatical case ending of the noun must agree with the grammatical case ending of its accompanying adjective.  

## Declension of Adjectives in Old Icelandic

There are two declensions in Old Icelandic, the strong and the weak.

### Strong Declension

#### Singular

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | langr     | lǫng     | langt
Acc. | langan    | langa    | langt
Dat. | lǫngum    | langri   | lǫngu
Gen. | langs     | langrar  | langs

#### Plural

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | langir     | langar  | lǫng
Acc. | langa     | langar   | lǫng
Dat. | lǫngum    | lǫngum   | lǫngum
Gen. | langra     | langra  | langra

#### Singular

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | gamall     | gǫmul     | gamalt
Acc. | gamlan    | gamla    | gamalt
Dat. | gǫmlum    | gamalli   | gǫmlu
Gen. | gamals     | gamallar  | gamals

#### Plural

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | gamlir     | gamlar  | gǫmul
Acc. | gamla     | gamlar   | gǫmul
Dat. | gǫmlum    | gǫmlum   | gǫmlum
Gen. | gamalla     | gamalla  | gamalla

The declension of _annarr_ is very interesing. It also always takes the strong declension.

#### Singular

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | annarr     | ǫnnur     | annat
Acc. | annan     | aðra    | annat
Dat. | ǫðrum    | annari   | ǫðrum
Gen. | annars     | annarrar  | annars

#### Plural

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | aðrir     | aðrar  | ǫnnur
Acc. | aðra     | aðrar   | ǫnnur
Dat. | ǫðrum    | ǫðrum  | ǫðrum
Gen. | annarra     | annarra  | annarra

### The Weak Declension

#### Singular

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | langi     | langa     | langa
Acc. | langa    | lǫngu    | langa
Dat. | langa    | lǫngu   | langa
Gen. | langa     | lǫngu  | langa

#### Plural

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | lǫngu     | lǫngu  | lǫngu
Acc. | lǫngu     | lǫngu   | lǫngu
Dat. | lǫngum    | lǫngum   | lǫngum
Gen. | lǫngu     | lǫngu  | lǫngu

### Adjective Usage in Old Icelandic

The usage of the strong and weak declensions is largely consistent with their usage in modern German. The weak adjectives were were used after the definite article or demonstrative pronoun. They were also used in noun constructions in which the article has been omitted, for instance, _Gizurr (inn) Hvíti_. Also note that the strong forms of _samr_ occured infrequently.

An adjective denoting part of a thing agreed with the noun (where English has 'of' in a partitive sense), for instance, _hálft dýrit_ 'half of the animal', _í miðju hafinu_, 'in the middle of the sea', _þeir margir_, 'many of them.'

### Declension of Present Participles and the Comparatives of Adjectives

#### Singular

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | hvassari     | hvassari     | hvassara
Acc. | hvassara    | hvassari    | hvassara
Dat. | hvassara    | hvassari   | hvassara
Gen. | hvassara     | hvassari  | hvassara

#### Plural

Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter
-----|-----------|----------|-------
Nom. | hvassari     | hvassari  | hvassari
Acc. | hvassari     | hvassari   | hvassari
Dat. | hvǫssurum    | hvǫssurum   | hvǫssurum
Gen. | hvassari     | hvassari  | hvassari

Other words that decline this way include,

_ellri, stærri, gefandi, deyandi..._.

### Comparison of Adjectives

The comparative and superlative forms of the adjectives are constructed with the suffixes, _-ari_, and _-astr_. Disyllables in _-ligr_ dropped the _-a_ of these endings.

Positive | Comparative | Superlative
---------|-------------|------------
hvass    | hvassari    | hvassaster
heilagr  | helgari     | helgastr
ríkr     | ríkari      | ríkastr
efniligr | efniligri   | efniligstr

The _j_ and the _v_ of adjectives like ríkr and gløggr were usually not retained in the comparative and superlative forms.

Positive | Comparative | Superlative
---------|-------------|------------
fagr     | fegri       | fegrstr
hár      |  hæri       |  hæstr
seinn    | seinni      |  seinstr

This category includes _fár, langr, lágr, skammr, smár, ungr, vænn_.

The following had comparative and superlative from a different root, or had no positive, the root appearing otherwise only in an adverb.

Positive | Comparative | Superlative
---------|-------------|------------
gamall   | ellri       | elztr
góðr     | betri       | beztr, baztr
illr, vándr | verri    | verstr
lítill   | minni       | minstr
mikill   | meiri       | mestr
         | œðri        |  œztr
(aptr)   | eptri       | apztr, aptastr
(fyrir)  | fyrri       | fyrstr
(of)     | øfri, efri  |  øfstr, efstr
(út)     | ýtri        | ýztr
(austr)  | eystri      | austastr

A comparative adjective might be followed by _en_ 'than' with the same case as the comparative, or, if _en_ was not used, by the dative: _launaði hann því fleira?_ 'Did he reward you with more than this?'
