# Prepositions

In Indo-European languages, prepositions activate the various nominal cases depending on the grammatical usage of the given preposition. During the development of the Proto-Indo-European parent language, many particles that were the ancestors of what we call prepositions were conditioning adverbs that triggered the grammatical through its associative verb. In the Germanic languages that still contain strong grammatical cases the preposition still governs the case in its phrase. Once the grammatical case is activated, the nouns likewise conform to the grammatical case governed by the preposition. In the case of Old Icelandic, prepositions activate the accusative, dative, or the genitive cases. Although a general sense of the case meaning is still preserved with many prepositions, there are some prepositions in which the original meaning of the case has been either lost or eclipsed by changes in usage.

Curiously, the case function in prepositional phrases in all Celtic languages have disappeared. All prepositions in Irish or Welsh activate what is commonly called "dative" but is really a non-functioning "prepositional" case.

## Prepositions that Activate Only the Genitive Case

The following prepositions activate the genitive case only. According to E.V. Gordon, the prepositional use of these words came relatively late.

* til
* innan
* milli
* sakir

## Prepositions that Activate Only the Dative Case

* af
* frá
* (í) gegn
* í hendr
* hjá
* móti
* nær
* ór
* undan

## Prepositions that Activate only the Accusative Case

Old Icelandic contains many compound prepositions that are constructed from the adverb, _fyrir_, or _fyr_ + and adverb ending in -an.

* fyrir austan, vestan, sunnan, norðan
* fyrir útan
* fyrir innan
* fyrir framan
* fyrir handan
* fyrir ofan
* fyrir neðan
...etc.

The ancient adverbial sense of this construction is retained in the usage of the prepositional particle, _fyr(ir)_. Also compare the many compound verbs that begin with this prefix in _Cleasby-Vigfusson_. This prefex is also cognate with German _ver-_ (verzeihen), English _for-_ (forgive), and Swedish _för-_ (förlåta).

* gegnum
* kringum
* umfram
* umhverfis (rare)

Keep in mind that _um_ and _fyrir_ in Old Icelandic activates both the accusative and the dative cases.

## Prepositions that Activate Both the Accusative and Dative Cases

Although certain prepositions play a part as an indicator, the action of the verb to the object noun ultimately activates the case in the phrase. As in German, the usage of these prepositions as dative or accusative prepositions is often idiomatic and must often be memorized, or understood as you encounter them. However a general rule applies with regard to the physical movement of the active noun. If physical motion or change is indicated by the phrase (if the active noun is in transit, for instance), the preposition activates the accusative case. If non-movement, or rest is indicated by the object noun, then the dative case is activated. These are the prepositions that take both the accusative and dative cases.

* á
* at (most often dat. in prose.)
* eptir
* í
* fyrir
* með
* of
* um
* undir
* við
* yfir

## Prepositions that Activate Both the Accusative and Genitive Cases

This unstable word is generally used with the accusative, but when compounded with nouns activates the genitive with its pairing. See Cleasby-Vigfusson.

* útan
