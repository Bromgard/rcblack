# The Grammatical Elements of Verbs

Just as nouns are conditioned by the grammatical structures of _case_, _number_, _gender_, and _definiteness_, so too is Icelandic governed by various conditions. Icelandic verbs are likewise conditioned by, _person_, _number_, _tense_, _mood_, and _voice_.

## Person

This grammatical condition operates in the same fashion is the literay voice of English, and most other European languages. The primary persons in Icelandic are the familiar _first_, _second_, and _third_ persons. Person is activated by the person condition of the nominative noun in each sentence.

_First Person_ is the linguistic source of the utterance, and in English the active pronoun of the subject is "I." The form is likewise "ék" in Old Icelandic.

_Second Person_ indicates the linguistic target of the utterance. In English the active pronoun of the subject is "you," and in Old Icelandic "þú."

_Third Person_ indicates the activity that is external and independent from the utterance itself. In English the active pronouns for this kind of statement is, "she," "he," "it," or "they."

Some linguists consider the functioning of the familiar "thou" in English and "du" in German (as opposed to "you" and "Sie") to be indicative of an independent _Second Person Familiar_ because the verb likewise changes to express the new condition. The changes in this case are closely associated with the verb's _number_.

## Number

The _number_ is conditioned by the number of nominative subjects in the utterance. "I," "you," and "s/he/it" are numbered _singular_ and the verbs likewise reflect this numbering. The cognate pronouns for this number in the third person are, "hann," "hon," and "þat." Also representative in all Indo-European verb systems is the _plural_, and the pronouns that indicate this numbering in English are "we," "you" (also singular but sometimes, "y'all"), and "they." The pronouns that form the nominative for these verbs are, "vér," "þér," (sometimes ér), and "þeir/þær/þau." Old Icelandic also contains the dual number ("vit," and "þit") but the verb system uses the plural form for this number.

## Tense

Barnes is correct when he says that Icelandic, as with all other Germanic languages, contain only two pure tenses, the _Simple Present_ and the _Simple Past_. Compensation for the loss of other useful tenses is introduced by the use of the auxiliary verb "to have," or, "hafa." The construction of these other tenses are very similar from one Germanic language to another. The usage of the auxiliary in Old Icelandic is therefore very easily to spot. It has been suggested that the usage of "hafa" in Germanic languages was introduced into the language from the grammar of Latin.

## Mood

There are three moods in the Old Icelandic verbal system, the _indicative_, the _subjunctive_, and the _imperative_ moods. The indicative mood communicates a simple action that takes place in the real world relative to the point of view of the utterance. The activity of the verb is something that actually happens. In its most simple form, the _subjunctive_ is a case that could happen, might happen in the future, or may have happened in the past. In English the subjunctive is entirely expressed by such modal auxiliary verbs that were used in the previous sentence. Old Icelandic does make use of these auxiliaries, but the verbs also heavily inflect to communicate the subjunctive case. The _imperative_ voice occurs only with a second person sentence. It is used to issue a command to do something. An example of this voicing is included in Barnes on page 135.

## Voice

Old Icelandic verbs have three voices, the _active_, _passive_, and the _middle_ voices. The _active voice_ is the condition in which the sentence communicates a simple action that is expressed by the verb that has been enabled by the nominative subject.

John paints the house.

This is a simple active sentence. In a sentence written in the _passive_ voice, the nominative subject is removed from the first position and the object takes the first position in the sentence.

The house is painted.

Or,

The house is painted by John.

The _middle_ voice is the reflexive form that end with the -sk ending. Barnes reports that this voicing has some similarities with the passive voice. This construction often expresses a simple active reflexive action, but overall the usage of this voice is also idiomatic. The term was coined by linguists to describe a grammatical voice that was in between the passive and active voice. This is a very complicated category, so I will cover this in more detail later.
