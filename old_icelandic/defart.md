# The Usage of the Definite article

It is very useful to introduce yourself to the un-suffixed form of the definite article. The paradigms are as follows:

## Singular

Case | Masc. | Fem. | Neu.
-----|-------|------|---
Nom. | inn | in | it
Acc. |inn | ina | it
Dat. | inum | inni | inu
Gen. | ins | innar | ins

## Plural

Case | Masc. | Fem. | Neu.
---|---|---|---
Nom. | inir | inar | in
Acc. | ina | inar | in
Dat. | inum | inum | inum
Gen. | inna | inna | inna

Certain changes occurred to this article form after they were suffixed to the nouns.

1. Barnes suggests to remember a key rule-of-thumb, that the complete article is suffixed in monosyllabic nouns and that the initial _i_ is omitted in polysyllabic words. Barnes also notes several exceptions to this rule on page 57. Also note that the terminal _m_ in the plural dative form is omitted with the definite suffix.

2. According to E.V. Gordon, _i_ is omitted after short unaccented vowels, and in disyllabic forms also after a long vowel as in _auga-t_, _á-nni_. The monosyllabic did not drop the initial vowel following a long vowel, as in _á-in_ 'the river.' The disyllabic forms with single _n_ usually dropped the initial vowel even after consonants, exept in the fem. acc. sg.: _fœtr-nir_, _dyr(r)-nar, brýn-nar_, and _nætr-nar_, but _gjöf-ina_ and _menn-inir_ (an unusual type). The _-m_ of the dat. pl. was dropped before the suffixed _-num_. (From _An Introduction to Old Norse_ by E.V. Gordon, pp. 295-6). See the examples below.

3. It is very important to remember that this in the first place is a reading class, and that it is more important to be able to make note of the forms as you read them. It is perhaps simpler to associate yourself with the patters as they come to you, and make note of the pattern as you build your vocabulary.
