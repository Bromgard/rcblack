This blog post is for my students in UCOR 1100, _The Islamic World and the West_. I'm very happy to meet all of you and I'm really looking forward to working with you this quarter. Things have been very difficult for everyone this quarter, and some of us have been certainly have been experiencing many more difficulties than others. For that reason we should hold ourselves together and help each other get through another quarter. Let's make this quarter a very good one despite all the difficulties. Let's work hard together to make the wold a better place.

## Of course I know him. He's me.

My name is Russell Black, but people call me Russ. I'm Dr. Black in a professional setting, but if you see me hanging out at the coffee shop you can call me by my first name. I grew up in a small town in Montana called Cut Bank. I think it's still there, just east of Glacier National Park on the other side of the Blackfeet Nation. I actually went to college twice. My first bout with college was at the University of Puget Sound, but I didn't finish there. I finished my undergraduate degree at the University of Massachusetts with a major in German Literature. After that I spent a few years working in record stores before I went back to graduate school at the University of Washington. My Ph.D. work is on Medieval Scandinavian literature, which most people know as the viking sagas. I sometimes teach the Old Norse language at the University of Washington. The rest of my time I spend teaching freshman writing at Seattle University.

## A few of my favorite things

I've always been a music person, so that's the thing I do to unwind most often. I'm not sure I have a favorite band, but the Pixies are close to my heart. In no particular order of importance I also like Radiohead, Pavement, Mission of Burma, Royal Trux, The Kinks, Coltrane, or Thee Oh Sees. I was looking forward to seeing King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard earlier this year, but the pandemic made sure that wasn't going to happen. I'm looking forward to being able to see a show as soon as all this is over with. When there's a nerd convention you can often spot me there too. If you see me at PAX or ECCC be sure to say hi. David Lynch's _Eraserhead_ has always been a formative movie for me. 

## My writing confidence, and my reading

Some people seem to have all the confidence they ever need, but I'm not one of them. I know that I'm a good writer, but I work very hard to get everything just right. I write, rewrite, and revise a lot before I'm comfortable letting anyone else look at it. I have never felt that writing and research is in any way easy, but I'm okay with that. I have others proofread for me, and I always rely on the help of other people. I've always been a reader. When I was in school I had a hard time doing the work I was supposed to do in school because I spent so much time time in the library. One day I came home to find that my parents packed away all my books so I would spend more time doing homework. All that being said, I'm a relatively slow reader, but I consider that to be an advantage. I seem to remember more details about the things I read than other people.

## The house companions

I have two furry roommates in my house. This first one is my cat Zoe, and she is the sweetest cat anyone could ever meet. The thing is, she's twenty one years old. She's pretty sick right now with cancer, but we're making things as comfortable as we can for her. She's still purring and she's still playful, so as long as she's still comfortable we're more than happy to keep her with us as long as she likes.

This second guy is my dog Tory, a ten year old Eskie. Like any other dog of this breed, he's always eager to tell us when someone is within half a mile of the house, if a bird exists, or that there's a cloud coming too close to his territory. He makes sure that he's always at the center of attention. His fur gets pretty much everywhere, particularly this time of year, but I'm used to it. I wear a lot of black, so I take a little of him wherever I go!
